We conducted a number of time series forecasts using Autogregressive (ARIMA), exponential state-space smoothing (ETS) and Facebook's "Prophet" model (Prophet). Final expected values were based on simple unweighted averages of the 3 estimates. 80% and 95% confidence intervals for each prediction are shown in the relevant plot.

Forecasts based on discharges from Wythenshawe over the period 2011 - 2022. This suggests an expected mean number of presentations per month of `r print_mean`. At this rate, we would expect ~`r print_mean` x 24 = `r print_mean*24` patients to have surgical repair of fractured neck of femur over the 24 month recruitment course of the trial.

                       arima_mean,
                       prophet_mean)) |> round(2)

```
Forecast modelling of length of stay (LOS) suggests an expected mean length of stay per patient of `r print_mean_2`. This means that while it is unlikely for patients to be in hospital longer than 2 weeks, we will have adequate time to give Anakinra for up to 72 hours post treatment, even if surgery is delayed.

A forecast based on the percentage of patients discharged from Wythenshawe who had a Spinal Anaesthetic over the period 2011 - 2022. This suggests an expected mean percentage Spinal recipients (simple average of 3 model estimates of %Spinal) of `r print_mean_4`%. 







## Outcome measures
### OSLA scale

![OSLA](Delirium-assessment-tool-OSLA.png){fig-align="center"} The OSLA scale is a 4-item scale with a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 15. Items respectively have a range of :

| Item        | Min | Max |
|-------------|-----|-----|

| Eye contact | 0   | 3   |

## Frequentist simulation

**Assumption:**: Delirium rating scales are ordinal measures, not interval measures (a person scoring 4 is not half as delirious as someone scoring 8)

**Solution**: Ordinal logistic regression does not assume interval scales, nor normal distributions of the scores. It does make a proportional-odds assumption testable using the parallel test. The coefficients can be interpreted as the log-odds of a one point increase in the scale score, $y$, with a one point (or one unit) increase in the predictor variable $x$.

**Assumption**: While delirium is by its nature a fluctuating condition, we assume there will be correlation within participants in delirium scale scores over time.

**Solution**: Mixed effects models will allow for an autoregressive correlation structure and regularisation of the model. Frequentist ordinal logistic mixed models are facilitated by R packages 'ordinal' and 'rms' and Bayesian mixed effects ordinal regression models are facilitated by packages 'brms' (with cumulative log-odds link function) and 'rmsb'. These have been used in simulation below.

**Assumption**: There may be significant anaesthetic methods (spinal/GA) in those presenting to the ED with hip fractures. The descriptive statistics for Wythenshawe hospital can be found below.

**Solution** Because the nature of the anaesthetic (spinal versus general) may relate to the nature of the participants' comorbidities and the presence or absence of preoperative delirium, we will use a minimisation strategy to ensure equal numbers of spinal and general anaesthetic procedures in each trial arm. The numbers of participants having GA will vary month-month.
