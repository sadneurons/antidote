# Template stage 1 standard application form
This Markdown template of the NIHR standard application form can be used to assist applicants in completing the online application form for NIHR funding; it cannot be submitted as an application. Only applications submitted online via the NIHR Central Commissioning Facility (CCF) Research Management System (RMS) will be accepted. However, information can be copied from the Word template into the online application form.

\newpage

## Introduction

This Word template of the NIHR standard application form is intended for applicants submitting stage 1 applications to the following NIHR research programmes:

-  [Invention for Innovation](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/explore-nihr/funding-programmes/invention-for-innovation.htm)
-  [Policy Research Programme](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/explore-nihr/funding-programmes/policy-research.htm)
-  [Programme Grants for Applied Research](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/explore-nihr/funding-programmes/programme-grants-for-applied-research.htm)
-  [Research for Patient Benefit](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/explore-nihr/funding-programmes/research-for-patient-benefit.htm)

This document shows the main fields in the standard application form for these programmes. Small variations by programme may exist in the online form in the CCF RMS. There are a number of guidance prompts available to you throughout the online form to help you when completing an application. It is strongly advised that you also read the relevant [Guidance for Applicants](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/about-us/document-library.htm?custom_in_type=9696) and [Supporting Information for Applicants](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/about-us/document-library.htm?custom_in_type=9729) documents before completing your application.

Stage 1 applications should observe the maximum word limits as indicated throughout the form. **Keep the use of acronyms to a minimum**. Only use acronyms where a term is used frequently throughout the application. If you do choose to use an acronym, do not assume that the reader knows what it means, and be sure to define it when first used.
 
You are strongly advised to structure the longer sections of the application form (particularly the Research Plan) in such a way that they can be read easily by reviewers. Schematics, tables, illustrations, graphs, and other types of graphics can be embedded to clarify the research plan but they should not clutter the central narrative. Images do not count towards the overall word count but inclusion of them to overcome word limits is not permitted. Images may only be included within the 'Research Plan.' Images included in other sections will be removed from the application and not seen by reviewers. **The use of long passages of dense, unstructured text should be avoided.**

Members of the research team will need to be registered through the system via email to participate as co-applicants after which they must confirm their participation. You will not be able to submit the application until co-applicants have confirmed and approved their involvement.
 
**Whilst confirming an application can be done at any time during the submission of an application, you are strongly advised to do this well in advance of the deadline.**

If you have any queries with your application, you can contact NIHR CCF on 020 8843 8000 or ccf@nihr.ac.uk.

## Section 4: Plain English summary of research

A plain English summary is a clear explanation of your research.

Many reviewers use this summary to inform their review of your funding application. They include clinicians, other practitioners and researchers who do not have specialist knowledge of your field as well as members of the public. If your application for funding is successful, the summary will be used on the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) and other websites.

A good quality plain English summary providing an easy to read overview of your whole study will help:

1.	those carrying out the review (reviewers and committee members) to have a better understanding of your research proposal
2.	inform others of about your research such as members of the public, health and social care professionals, policy makers and the media
3.	the research funders to publicise the research that they fund

If it is felt that your plain English summary is not clear and of good quality, then you may be required to amend it prior to final funding approval.

It is helpful to involve patients/carers/service users/practitioners and members of the public in developing a plain English summary.

**Content**

When writing your summary consider including the following information where appropriate:

1.	aim(s) of the research
2.	background to the research
3.	design and methods used
4.	patient and public involvement
5.	dissemination

The plain English summary is not the same as a scientific abstract - please do not cut and paste this or other sections of your application form to create the plain English summary. 

Further guidance on writing in plain English is available online at [NIHR Plain English summaries](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/documents/plain-english-summaries/27363).

For further support and advice on writing a plain English summary, please contact your local [Research Design Service](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/explore-nihr/support/research-design-service.htm) (where applicable).

\newpage

## Section 5: Research plan

### Research Plan
Using all of the headings in the order presented below, please use this section to clearly explain your proposed research. Schematics, tables, illustrations, graphs, and other types of graphics can be embedded to clarify the research plan but they should not clutter the central narrative. Images do not count towards the overall word count but inclusion of them to overcome word limits is not permitted. Images may only be included within the ‘Research Plan’. Images included in other sections will be removed from the application and not seen by reviewers.

For further information about what is required under each heading, please refer to the guidance for applicants.

As this is the main part of your application which will be considered by the reviewing committee, you should ensure that the information is accurate, succinct, clearly laid out and provides sufficient methodological detail.

NOTE: Applicants should aim to reserve a significant proportion of the word count for the project plan to enable methodological approaches to be fully specified.

1.	What is the problem being addressed?
2.	Why is this research important in terms of improving the health and/or wellbeing of the public and/or to patients and health care services?
3.	Review of existing evidence – How does the existing literature support this proposal?
4.	What is the research question / aims and objectives?
5.	Project plan
6.	(Intellectual Property and commercialisation)

\newpage

## Section 6: Uploads

### Mandatory 
Attach one single-side A4 page listing references used throughout your proposal.



### Non-mandatory 
If required, an additional supporting (single side of A4) document can be submitted with your application form (e.g., a flow diagram illustrating the study design and the flow of participants, Gantt chart, response to feedback from a previous submission, letter of support etc.). If submitting a flow diagram, applicants should also describe complex interventions and controls as accurately and fully as possible within their diagram. If proposing an RCT, we advise you refer to the CONSORT statement and website for guidance. Alternatively, you may find the EQUATOR Network website useful. The PDF file should be submitted along with your application form.


NOTE: Uploads MUST be provided as a Word or PDF document or you may not be able to submit your application or it may be difficult for the committee to view the required information in order to assess your application.
