      Manchester Data Management Outline


1. Will this project be reviewed by any of the following bodies (please
select all that apply)?


  * Ethics
  * Funder



2. Is The University of Manchester collaborating with other institutions
on this project?


  * Yes - Part of a collaboration and owning or handling data

The trial will be sponsored by the University of Manchester but the
funding will be hosted by Greater Manchester Mental Health Foundation
Trust, as this is a requirement of NIHR funding.



3. What data will you use in this project (please select all that apply)?


  * Acquire new data

New data will be generated in the course of the clinical trial. A full
list of variables collected will be added both here and to the protocol.



4. Where will the data be stored and backed-up during the project lifetime?


  * Other storage system (please list below)

Clinical Trials Unit Data storage and entry system.



5. If you will be using Research Data Storage, how much storage will you
require?


  * < 1 TB

Clinical Trial data will be strored. Thsi data is likely to consist of

neuroimaging or other information associated wilth large datafiles.



6. *Are you going to be receiving data from, or sharing data with an
external third party?*

Highly restricted information defined in the Information security
classification, ownership and secure information handling SOP
<https://documents.manchester.ac.uk/DocuInfo.aspx?DocID=29971> is
information that requires enhanced security as unauthorised disclosure
could cause significant harm to individuals or to the University and its
ambitions in respect of its purpose, vision and values. This could be:
information that is subject to export controls; valuable intellectual
property; security sensitive material or research in key industrial
fields at particular risk of being targeted by foreign states. See more
examples of highly restricted information
<https://documents.manchester.ac.uk/DocuInfo.aspx?DocID=15677>. 

Personal information, also known as personal data, relates to
identifiable living individuals. Personal data is classed as special
category personal data if it includes any of the following types of
information about an identifiable living individual: racial or ethnic
origin; political opinions; religious or similar philosophical beliefs;
trade union membership; genetic data; biometric data; health data;
sexual life; sexual orientation.

Please note that in line with data protection law
<https://www.staffnet.manchester.ac.uk/igo/data-protection/what-is-data-protection/> (the UK General Data Protection Regulation and Data Protection Act 2018), personal information should only be stored in an identifiable form for as long as is necessary for the project; it should be pseudonymised (partially de-identified) and/or anonymised (completely de—identified) as soon as practically possible. You must obtain the appropriate ethical approval <https://www.staffnet.manchester.ac.uk/rbe/ethics-integrity/ethics/erm/> in order to use identifiable personal data.

*8. What type of information will you be processing (please select all
that apply)? *

  * Pseudonymised personal data
  * Personal information, including signed consent forms



9. How do you plan to store, protect and ensure confidentiality of any
highly restricted data or personal data (please select all that apply)?

  * Other (please list below in less than 100 words)
  * Access data hosted by a third-party data provider via their secure
    facilities (e.g. the UK Data Service Secure Lab)
  * Access data hosted by the University of Manchester via its secure
    Virtual Private Network (VPN)
  * Where needed, follow University of Manchester guidelines for
    disposing of personal data
  * Impose suitable non-disclosure agreements (e.g. for managers or
    users of personal data)
  * Impose suitable data sharing and collaboration agreements
  * Pseudonymise data and apply secure key management procedures
  * Store data in encrypted files, folders, computers or devices
  * Store data in buildings, rooms or filing cabinets with controlled access

Data antry will be performed by clinical trial researchers a the point
of collection. Data will be cleaned and stored before database lock and
statistical analysis. This data will be held on the relveant CTU data
management system.

10. If you are storing personal information (including contact details)
will you need to keep it beyond the end of the project?


  * Yes – Funder requirement

PArticipants must be contactable after the end of the study in case of
adverse events or the emergence of information about novel drug side
effects (for example).



11. Will the participants’ information (personal and/or sensitive) be
shared with or accessed by anyone outside of the University of Manchester?


  * No

No, data will be pseudonymised using participant clinical trial numbers
before entry into either the randomisation service portal or the trial
data management system.



12. If you will be sharing personal information outside of the
University of Manchester will the individual or organisation you are
sharing with be outside the EEA?


  * Not applicable



13. Are you planning to use the personal information for future purposes
such as research?


  * No

PErsonal information will be used only in order to contact participants
with plain English summaries of trial outcomes, which they or their
relative can opt out of.



14. Will this project use innovative technologies to collect or process
data?


  * No
