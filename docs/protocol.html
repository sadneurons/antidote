<p>The sponsor has had no role in the design of the protocol or trial. The sponsor maintains responsibility for trial conduct, indemnity, data security and oversight. The sponsor will ensure provision is made for insurance or indemnity to cover liabilities which may arise in relation to the design, management and conduct of the clinical trial. The sponsor will provide investigator(s) with the necessary information to conduct the clinical trial, ensure proper monitoring of the clinical study, ensure all necessary ethic review(s) and approval(s) are obtained. The sponsor will ensure that any reviewing ethics board and regulatory agencies are promptly informed of any significant new information (for example, important findings that affect product safety). The sponsor will ensure compliance with labelling, reporting and record-keeping requirements. The sponsor will ensure that the clinical study is conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the Declaration of Helsinki. The sponsor will ensure that roles and responsibilities of the parties involved in the research and any delegation by the sponsor of its tasks are agreed and documented. The sponsor will ensure appropriate arrangements are made for making information about the research publicly available before it starts (unless a deferral is agreed by or on behalf of the research ethics committee); agreeing appropriate arrangements for making data and tissue accessible, with adequate consent and privacy safeguards, in a timely manner after it has finished; and ensuring arrangements for information about the findings of the research to be made available, including, where appropriate, to participants (For educational research, registration, accessibility of data and tissues, and dissemination may be limited to institutional arrangements). The sponsor will ensure that, where expected or required, the research has approval from a research ethics committee (Whether outright or following a provisional opinion, resubmission or appeal) and any other relevant approval bodies before it begins. The sponsor will verify that regulatory and practical arrangements are in place, before permitting the research to begin in a safe and timely manner. The sponsor will ensure adequate arrangements for finance and management of the research project, including its competent risk management and data management.</p>
<!-- Aim: To clarify the potential influence of sponsor and funders over the trial -->
<!-- The sponsor can be defined as the company, institution, or organisation assuming overall responsibility for the initiation and management of the trial, and is not necessarily the main funder. Identification of the trial sponsor provides transparency and accountability.  -->
<!-- The protocol should explicitly outline the roles and responsibilities of the sponsor(s) and any funder(s) in trial design, conduct, data analysis and interpretation, manuscript writing, and dissemination of results. It is also important to state the obligation of the sponsor or funder in terms of the final decision regarding any of these aspects of the trial. -->
<!-- NB in a CTIMP the sponsor has legal responsibilities that cannot be delegated. -->

<p>The idea for the use of Anakinra in preventing and treating delirium emerged from conversations between Prof.&nbsp;Colm Cunningham and Prof.&nbsp;Stuart Allan during and after an invited lecture at the <a href="https://gjbrainresearch.org/">Geoffrey Jefferson Brain Research Centre (GJBRC)</a> at the University of Manchester. As Anakinra had been shown during the COVID19 pandemic to reduce the ‘cytokine storm’ associated with infection with the SARS-Cov-19 virus, th e rationale of extending use to delirium, where IL-1 production has been demonstrated in animals and humans to drive inflammatory responses and altered mentation, seemed promising. The GJBRC was created in 2021 to bring basic and clinical scientists together for the rapid translation of scientific findings into life-changing therapies for major health problems.</p>

<h3 data-number="1.6" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-bg"><span class="header-section-number">1.6</span> BACKGROUND</h3>
<p><strong>Delirium</strong>Delirium is a syndrome of disturbed alertness, orientation and arousal, complicated by neuropsychiatric abnormalities like paranoia and hallucinations. A single episode of delirium may permanently damage cognition(1) and increases the risk of dementia 3-fold over the following 3 years(2). Delirium is more common in older people and occurs in 20% of hospital inpatients and 40% of postoperative surgical patients, including those undergoing hip repair(3). Up to 90% of those who fracture their hip have underlying abnormalities in biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease (rising to 98% in those with known mild cognitive problems)(4).</p>
<p><strong>Hip fracture</strong> In the UK, 65,000 people fracture their hip every year(3). On average, 7% of these people will die within a month of their fracture. Postoperative delirium doubles the risk of death in the 12 months after fracture(5), especially if superimposed on pre-existing dementia(6). So, hip fracture is a major public health concern, both hastening dementia onset and causing premature death in those living with dementia. There is currently no treatment that prevents or shortens the duration of delirium, and no promising candidate. Delirium is often treated by addressing the underlying contributors (e.g.&nbsp;infection, pain, sedating medicines) and using sensitive nursing practice and clear communication. This can improve outcomes. However, after hip surgery, delirium impairs the early mobilisation and engagement with physiotherapy vital for good postoperative outcomes in dementia, like mobility and discharge to your own home.</p>
<p><strong>Hip fracture types</strong></p>

<h4 data-number="1.6.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="review-of-existing-evidence"><span class="header-section-number">1.6.1</span> Review of existing evidence</h4>
<p><strong>Pre-clinical:</strong> IL-1 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine pivotal to the earliest stages of inflammatory response(7). It induces IL-6 and IL-8 gene expression and promotes lymphocyte differentiation and cellular immune response. The most prevalent preclinical model of delirium uses injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to switch on the inflammatory cascade. IL-1 in isolation can mimic the cognitive effects of LPS in this model(8). Blockade of IL-1 action using recombinant receptor antagonists prevents the pro-inflammatory effects of LPS in these animal models of delirium(8). Thus, blockade of this early, amplifying step in the pro-inflammatory cytokine cascade may prevent cognitive deterioration.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical:</strong> In humans, IL-1 is a key driver of neuroinflammation after hip fracture, with raised CSF and serum levels(9).</p>
<p>Anakinra is a specific IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) already in use for patients with autoimmune disease including arthritis and those with critical lung disease due to COVID. It is an analogue of the naturally produced human IL1 receptor antagonist.</p>
<p><strong>Aim</strong> The aim of the research is to examine whether Anakinra can reduce the incidence of delirium post hip repair in older people. Anakinra is an interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist licensed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. It is given subcutaneously twice daily, ideal for inpatients with delirium who may not be able to take oral medications. We will conduct a double-blind randomised controlled trial of Anakinra in older people after hip fracture.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives</strong> The objectives, in priority order, are to compare subcutaneous Anakinra to placebo given twice daily during the perioperative period in terms of: 1. (1°) Severity of delirium postoperatively as measured by the XXXXXXXX 2. (2°) Time to first weight bearing postoperatively 3. (3°) Time until medically fit for discharge postoperatively 4. (3°) Safety of Anakinra during the perioperative period and in wound healing 5. (3°) Tolerability of Anakinra versus placebo in terms of common side effects 6. (3°) Effect of Anakinra on 30-day mortality</p>
<p><strong>Exclusion criteria:</strong> 1. Lack of a study partner or caregiver 2. Active infection 3. History of hypersensitivity to or unacceptable side effects of Anakinra 4. Current substance misuse 5. Active malignancy 6. Acute stroke or TIA 7. Currently participating in clinical trial of an investigational medicinal product (CTIMP) 8. Women of child-bearing potential 9. Neutropenia of any cause.</p>

<p>The minmum clinically significant difference in any of the candidate delirium scales is not well established in the literature. It is clear that preventing cases of delirium will have significant positive economic outcomes for the NHS. Therefore, it would be possible to reason backwards from utilities to a minimum number of prevented cases. However, it is not clear that a reduction in the severity of delirium is associated with a shorter duration of delirium (intuitively appealing as that may be). It is also not clear that a reduction in the severity of delirium is associated with a shorter hospital stay per se, because no treatment has been found which effectively reduces severity. Therefore, we have chosen measures which seek to measure the primary outcome - delirium severity, and measure as secondary outcomes important clinical endpoints such as time-to-stand and time to medical fitness-for-discharge, because there are many confounding postoperative factors apart from delirium which might influence their outcome, significantly lowering the signal-noise ratio. <!-- Aim: To place the trial in the context of available evidence.  --></p>

<!-- Aim: To describe the ideal design for the research question and what the trial is designed to show.  -->
<!-- The framework of a trial refers to its overall objective to test: -->
<!--     • the superiority (treatment is superior to placebo or comparator treatment) -->
<!--     • non-inferiority (‘not worse than’ the comparator treatment) -->
<!--     • equivalence (treatment is similar to the comparator treatment ) of one intervention with another -->
<!--     • in the case of exploratory pilot trials, to gather preliminary information on the intervention (e.g. harm, pharmacokinetics, etc.) and the feasibility of conducting a full-scale trial -->
<!-- Common designs include:  -->
<!--     • Parallel group design: each group of participants receives only one of the trial treatments. -->
<!--     • Cross-over design: each of the participants is given all the trial treatments in successive periods. The order in which the participants receive each treatment is determined at random.  -->
<!--     • Factorial design: two or more treatments are evaluated separately and in combination against a control. For instance, in a factorial design to assess the effect of drug A and drug B for the treatment of pain, participants would receive drug A only, drug B only, a combination of drug A and B, or placebo. -->
<!--     • Cluster randomised controlled trials: the treatment is randomised to groups of participants (e.g. families) rather than individual participants. -->
<!--     • Groups sequential: outcomes are assessed in a group and sequential manner -->
<!--     • Multiple-armed design: trial with more than two arms. For example, a three-armed trial comparing a treatment with inactive control/placebo, and an alternative active treatment -->
<!--     • Pragmatic trial: reflects variations between patients that occur in real clinical practice and aims to inform choices between treatments. Although these are called pragmatic the same level of detail is required outlining the design as all other trials.  -->
<!-- There is increasing interest in adaptive designs for clinical trials, defined as the use of accumulating data to decide how to modify aspects of a trial as it continues, without undermining the validity and integrity of the trial. Examples of potential adaptations include stopping the trial early, modifying the allocation ratio, re-estimating the sample size, and changing the eligibility criteria. The most valid adaptive designs are those in which the opportunity to make adaptations is based on pre-specified decision rules that are fully
documented in the protocol. -->

<!--     • females must not be breastfeeding. -->
<!--     • Males - For genotoxic IMPs, the male participant should use condom during treatment and until the end of relevant systemic exposure in the male participant, plus a further 90-day period. For a non-pregnant WOCBP partner, contraception recommendations should also be considered. -->

They must ensure that any person delegated responsibility to participate in the informed consent process is duly authorised, trained and competent to participate according to the ethically approved protocol, principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and Declaration of Helsinki. If delegation of consent is acceptable then details should be provided. -->
<!-- Informed consent must be obtained prior to the participant undergoing procedures that are specifically for the purposes of the trial and are out-with standard routine care at the participating site (including the collection of identifiable participant data unless the trial has prior approval from the Confidentiality Advisory Group (CAG) and the Research Ethics Committee (REC)) -->
<!-- The right of a participant to refuse participation without giving reasons must be respected.   -->
<!-- The participant must remain free to withdraw at any time from the trial without giving reasons and without prejudicing his/her further treatment and must be provided with a contact point where he/she may obtain further information about the trial. Data and samples collected up to the point of withdrawal can only be used after withdrawal if the participant has consented for this. Any intention to utilise such data should be outlined in the consent literature. Where a participant is required to re-consent or new information is required to be provided to a participant it is the responsibility of the PI to ensure this is done in a timely manner.  -->
<!-- The PI takes responsibility for ensuring that all vulnerable participants are protected and participate voluntarily in an environment free from coercion or undue influence -->
<!-- Where the participant population is likely to include a significant proportion of participants who cannot read or write, require translators or have cognitive impairment, appropriate alternative methods for supporting the informed consent process should be employed. This may include allowing a witness to sign on a participant’s behalf (in the case of problems with reading or writing), or allowing someone to date the form on behalf of the participant, or providing Participant Information Sheets in other languages or in a format easily understood by the participant population (in the case of minors or cognitive impairment). -->

<!-- The protocol should specify what arrangements the sponsor considers to be appropriate at site(s) to support the consent process for these participants. For example, if verbal translation is needed, should this be via a hospital interpreter or a independent interpreter; are telephone translation services acceptable; if translated written material is to be provided to participants, are these to be provided by the sponsor, or translated locally, and what arrangements are in place to confirm the accuracy of the translation, e.g. back translation; if age appropriate information for minors is to be provided, what age ranges is this divided into; if parent/guardian consent for a minor to participate is being sought, what are the acceptable relationships of the guardian to the minor? -->
<!-- Note that for studies involving sites in Wales, to comply with the Welsh Language Act 1993, the Participant Information Sheets and Consent forms must be translated into Welsh or provided bilingually where this is requested by a participant at a research site. -->
<!-- The protocol should fully describe the process which typically involves: -->

<!--     • discussion between the potential participant or his/her legally acceptable representative and an individual knowledgeable about the research about the nature and objectives of the trial and possible risks associated with their participation -->
<!--     • the presentation of written material (e.g., information leaflet and consent document which must be approved by the REC and be in compliance with GCP, local regulatory requirements and legal requirements -->
<!--     • the opportunity for potential participants to ask questions -->
<!--     • assessment of capacity. For consent to be ethical and valid in law, participants must be capable of giving consent for themselves. A capable person will:  -->
<!--         ◦ understand the purpose and nature of the research  -->
<!--         ◦ understand what the research involves, its benefits (or lack of benefits), risks and burdens  -->
<!--         ◦ understand the alternatives to taking part  -->
<!--         ◦ be able to retain the information long enough to make an effective decision. -->
<!--         ◦ be able to make a free choice  -->
<!--         ◦ be capable of making this particular decision at the time it needs to be made (though their capacity may fluctuate, and they may be capable of making some decisions but not others depending on their complexity) -->
<!--         ◦ where participants are capable of consenting for themselves but are particularly susceptible to coercion, it is important to explain how their interests will be protected -->
<!-- General good practice in research (and the basis of legal frameworks relating to both CTIMPs and non-CTIMPs) require that persons incapable of giving legal consent should be given special protection.  -->
<!-- A person is assumed to have the mental capacity to make a decision unless it is shown to be absent. Mental capacity is considered to be lacking if, in a specific circumstance, a person is unable to make a decision for him or herself because of impairment or a disturbance in the functioning of their mind or brain. In practice for participants with mental incapacity this means that they should not be included in clinical trials if the same results can be obtained using persons capable of giving consent and should only be included where there are grounds for expecting that their taking part will be of direct benefit to that participant, thereby outweighing the risks. The Mental Capacity Act 2005 does not apply to CTIMPs. -->
<!-- The Clinical Trial Regulations define a child as a person under the age of 16 years of age.  The legal framework and ethical considerations for involving young people (between the ages of 16 and 17) in research are set out in the Department of Health Reference Guide to Consent for Examination or Treatment (2009) and should be referred to for any trial including young people (between the ages of 16 and 17). In practice for young people and children this means that only medicinal products which are likely to be of significant value for young people and children are fully studied and the protection of participating children is fully considered.  -->
<!-- For further details on the ethical considerations of including persons with mental incapacity or minors in research see the guidance notes available on the HRA website.  -->
<!-- http://www.hra.nhs.uk/resources/before-you-apply/consent-and-participation/consent-and-participant-information/ -->
<!-- Where the trial allows the inclusion of participants who lack the capacity to consent for themselves (for example, in cases where the research is related to the disease / illness causing mental incapacity) the full procedure for consent by a legal representative must be included in the protocol, along with appropriate information sheets and consent forms.  -->
<!-- The issue of entry of incapacitated adults into CTIMPs is covered by The Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations and the required procedures to be included in the trial protocol are detailed within these regulations. For studies involving Scottish research sites these Regulations supersede the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000 where any conflict arises. The specific schedules of the Regulations must be read and adhered to by the protocol authors. -->
<!-- Where a participant is able to consent for a CTIMP but later becomes incapacitated, the management of these participants must also be stipulated in the protocol; in all such cases the original consent given endures the loss of capacity, providing that the trial has not significantly altered (there may be clinical justification under such circumstances for cessation of any further clinical intervention while data collection for follow-up purposes continues). -->
<!-- ####   Additional consent provisions for collection and use of participant data and biological specimens in ancillary studies, if applicable -->
<!-- Aim: to describe the consenting procedure for ancillary studies (if applicable) -->
<!-- The protocol should state: -->
<!--     • if data and/or biological specimens for ancillary studies will be acquired, transferred and stored during the trial (in line with section 7.11). -->
<!--     • if the data and/or biological specimens will be used for a specified subset of studies or for submission to ethically approved research tissue banks for future specified or unspecified research -->

<!-- The protocol should describe: -->
<!--     • The method of randomisation e.g.: -->
<!--     • simple randomisation based solely on a single, constant allocation ratio is known as simple randomisation. Simple randomisation with a 1:1 allocation ratio is analogous to a coin toss. No other method of allocation surpasses the bias prevention and unpredictability of simple randomisation -->
<!--     • restricted randomisation which includes any randomised approach that is not simple randomisation including:-  -->
<!--         ◦ Blocked randomisation -->
<!--         ◦ Biased coin and urn randomisation -->
<!--         ◦ Stratified randomisation -->
<!--     • if an un-equal treatment allocation will be used and a justification for its use -->
<!--     • if the allocation ratio will adaptively evolve over the course of the trial and a short overview statement to that effect with a reference  to the full description in the “Interim Analysis” section -->
<!--     • if minimisation is going to be used. Minimisation assures similar distribution of selected participant factors between trial groups. The first participant is truly randomly allocated; for each subsequent participant, the treatment allocation that minimises the imbalance on the selected factors between groups at that time is selected. That allocation may then be used, or a choice may be made at random with a heavy weighting in favour of the intervention that would minimise imbalance (for example, with a probability of 0.8).  -->
<!-- Full details of a restricted randomisation scheme (including minimisation) should not be included in the trial protocol as knowledge of these details might undermine randomisation by facilitating deciphering of the allocation sequence. Instead, this specific information should be provided in a separate document with restricted access to protect the trial from selection/allocation bias -->

<!-- State who will receive new patient/randomisation alerts (preferably to include pharmacy), together with research nurse and/or investigator. Describe how these alerts will be received. -->
<!-- Studies that involve a trial-specific procedure prior to randomisation must include a registration phase prior to randomisation. Describe the procedure for registration and how it relates to subsequent randomisation e.g. -->
<!--     • After randomisation, if a patient is eligible for randomisation do they get allocated a randomisation number to be used in conjunction with the registration number?  -->
<!--     • Who will be informed of the patient registration and how? -->

<p>The number of doses of Anakinra given may differ between participants. 60% of participants are expected to have surgical repair within 24 hours (based on summary descriptive statistics from the National Hip Fracture Database). Therefore, we will continue to give doses of subcutaneous Anakinra twice daily for 72 hours after surgical repair. <!--     • Where dosage is dependent on laboratory data, specify whether blood specimens must be taken on the day of dosing or specimens can be taken in advance in line with routine local procedure. --></p>

<p>Doses will be reduced if participants weigh under 50kg. For participants under 50kg a dose of Anakinra of 1.5mg/kg will be used. <!-- Aim: To give deails here on required dose modifications (if applicable) --> <!-- The protocol should detail: --> Protocol deviations due to missed doses will be treated as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>A.M. doses should be given at the usual time for A.M. medication for inpatients, usually between 8 and 9 a.m.</p></li>
<li><p>Doses given after 10 a.m. will be considered protocol deviations and recorded as such. The median time at A.M. and P.M. dosing will be recorded and reported in the trial report, as will the median duration between doses.</p></li>
<li><p>The A.M. Dose will be considered “missed” if it is not given by 12 noon that day. In these cases, this should be recorded as a protocol deviation and omitted. In these cases the participant will only receive the P.M. dose. <!--     • if the dose should be modified for example in the case of certain adverse events (specify the exact dose modifications and events) --></p></li>
</ol>
<!--     • the stopping rules (for individual participants and the trial as a whole) -->
<p><strong>Intubation and I.V. sedation</strong> for any medical reason will render the measurement of delirium parameters impossible. Therefore, ICU admission, intubation or sedation with e.g.&nbsp;I.V Propofol will mean the participant receives no further doses of study medication or placebo, while the change in clinical status will be registered as a SUSAR.</p>
<!--     • the restarting rules (for individual participants and the trial as a whole) -->
<p>Once a participant is withdrawn from the study, dosing with study medicine or placebo will not be reinitiated. <!--     • treatment breaks/ drug-free holidays  --> As the treatment will only continue for the duration of the participant’s hospitalisation, we expect there will be no reason for treatment breaks or drug-free holidays during the course of the study. <!--     • whether patients can increase the dose if they have previously been dose reduced for some reason. Also what about treatment breaks/ drug-free holidays --> There will be no cause for increasing doses after missed doses, nor will a dosing regime be extended because of a prolngewd stay in hospital. <!--     • whether the dosage will be modified in accordance with the patients results (e.g. lab results – and what the results should be) and whether this will be completed under controlled hospital conditions or whether the patient will be required to adjust their own dosages following medical guidance at home --></p>
<!--     • whether the dose can be modified due to patient request -->
<p>The dose can not be modified due to participant or relative request. The dose can not be modified sue to clinician or professional request. <!--     • procedures in the event of toxicity reactions (if applicable) e.g. if it is possible to reduce the dosage of IMP or if any rescue medication may need to be administered --> <strong>Local toxicity reactions with Anakinra are not common.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Site reactions</strong> are common after prolonged dosing and usually result in inflammation, erythema and discoloration around injection sites. As trial participants will only be receiving 8 to 10 injections, and with the benefit of the rotation of sites, we do not anticipate site reactions which would result in either unblinding or discomfort for participants. If site reactions occur, they will be treated as per clinical guidance, by ensuring rotation of the injection site, providing pain relief and careful participant positioning. Site reactions will be reported as a Serious Adverse Event of Interest, but treatment may continue.</p>
<p>Anaphylactic reactions will be dealt with using the local anaphylaxis guidance for Manchester Foundation Trust, and referred for post-anaphylaxis care if possible at the Greater Manchester Rapid Access Anaphylaxis Clinic.<br>

<!-- Term -->
<!-- Definition -->
<!-- Adverse Event (AE) -->
<!-- Any untoward medical occurrence in a participant to whom a medicinal product has been administered, including occurrences which are not necessarily caused by or related to that product. -->
<!-- Adverse Reaction (AR) -->
<!-- An untoward and unintended response in a participant to an investigational medicinal product which is related to any dose administered to that participant. -->
<!-- The phrase "response to an investigational medicinal product" means that a causal relationship between a trial medication and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility, i.e. the relationship cannot be ruled out. -->
<!-- All cases judged by either the reporting medically qualified professional or the Sponsor as having a reasonable suspected causal relationship to the trial medication qualify as adverse reactions. It is important to note that this is entirely separate to the known side effects listed in the SmPC. It is specifically a temporal relationship between taking the drug, the half-life, and the time of the event or any valid alternative etiology that would explain the event. -->
<!-- Serious Adverse Event (SAE) -->
<!-- A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that: -->
<!--     • results in death -->
<!--     • is life-threatening -->
<!--     • requires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation -->
<!--     • results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity -->
<!--     • consists of a congenital anomaly or birth defect -->
<!-- Other ‘important medical events’ may also be considered serious if they jeopardise the participant or require an intervention to prevent one of the above consequences. -->
<!-- NOTE: The term "life-threatening" in the definition of "serious" refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. -->
<!-- Serious Adverse Reaction (SAR) -->
<!-- An adverse event that is both serious and, in the opinion of the reporting Investigator, believed with reasonable probability to be due to one of the trial treatments, based on the information provided. -->
<!-- Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) -->
<!-- A serious adverse reaction, the nature and severity of which is not consistent with the information about the medicinal product in question set out in the reference safety information: -->
<!--     • in the case of a product with a marketing authorisation, this could be in the summary of product characteristics (SmPC) for that product, so long as it is being used within it’s licence. If it is being used off label an assessment of the SmPCs suitability will need to be undertaken. -->
<!--     • in the case of any other investigational medicinal product, in the investigator’s brochure (IB) relating to the trial in question -->
<!-- NB: to avoid confusion or misunderstanding of the difference between the terms “serious” and “severe”, the following note of clarification is provided: “Severe” is often used to describe intensity of a specific event, which may be of relatively minor medical significance. “Seriousness” is the regulatory definition supplied above. -->

<!-- Aim: to provide operational definitions for (S)AEs -->
<!-- This section of the protocol must describe the following for (S)AEs and for (Serious) Adverse Reactions ((S)ARs): -->
<!--    a) What will be reported to the Sponsor and using which CRF -->
<!--    b) Whether (S)AEs and (S)ARs will be evaluated for duration and intensity according to  standard references such as the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria   for Adverse Events V4.0 (NCI-CTCAE) -->
<!-- The identification of (S)AEs and (S)ARs that require reporting to the Sponsor will differ for individual trials and will be influenced by: -->
<!--     1. The nature of the intervention, for example: -->
<!--     • CTIMP with well known safety profile; using licensed drug(s) in licensed indication: in such trials it may be considered appropriate that certain AEs and ARs are not required to be reported, but should be recorded, if they will not improve the knowledge regarding the safety profile of the drug and are not required for the trial analysis.  -->
<!--     • CTIMP with less well known safety profile; using unlicensed drug(s) or licensed drug(s) outside of the licensed indication and where little class evidence is available. In such trials it would be considered appropriate that all ARs are required to be reported with consideration given to whether all or certain AEs will be reported. NB All AEs must be recorded in order to make a judgement on whether they should be reported.  -->
<!--     • Any reduced reporting must be justified and in-line with the documented risk assessment (section 2.1) as per MHRA guidance.  -->
<!--     • For blinded CTIMPs with high morbidity or mortality, where efficacy endpoints could also be SUSARs, the integrity of the trial may be compromised if the blind is systematically broken and under these or similar circumstances such SUSARs / SARs would be treated as disease related and not subject to systematic unblinding. The MHRA require that all SUSARs are reported unblended. -->
<!--     2. The endpoints or design of the trial, for example: -->
<!--     • Anticipated SAEs for the disease and trial drug / intervention should be listed in the protocol or Reference Safety Information and it should be stated that these would not be considered to be SUSARs unless the severity of the event was considered to be unexpected. Where SAEs are listed but happen rarely then an explanation of the likely risk of an event may be considered of value.  -->
<!--     • Where efficacy endpoints could also be (S)AEs or (S)ARs the integrity of the trial may be compromised by having such events reported through the safety monitoring / pharmacovigilance process.  In such cases, the protocol can specify that deterioration of the existing condition or known side-effects recorded as primary or secondary endpoints are not reported as (S)AEs or (S)ARs but are recorded separately. For example, the protocol can specify that deterioration of the existing condition or known side-effects recorded as primary or secondary endpoints are not reported as adverse events. -->
<!--     • Other exceptions may include hospitalisation for: -->
<!--         ◦ Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication not associated with any deterioration in condition. -->
<!--         ◦ Treatment which was elective or pre-planned, for a pre-existing condition not associated with any deterioration in condition, e.g. pre-planned hip replacement operation which does not lead to further complications. -->
<!--         ◦ Any admission to hospital or other institution for general care where there was no deterioration in condition. -->
<!--         ◦ Treatment on an emergency, outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of serious as given above and not resulting in hospital admission. -->
<!-- In all cases AEs and / or laboratory abnormalities that are critical to the safety evaluation of the participant must be reported to the Sponsor; these may be volunteered by the participant, discovered by the investigator questioning or detected through physical examination, laboratory test or other investigation. Where certain AEs are not required to be reported to the Sponsor, these should still be recorded in the participant’s medical records. Clear guidance in the protocol should state where this is the case. -->

<!-- When determining the anticipated nature of ARs and SARs, appropriate Reference Safety Information (RSI) must be used, for instance an IB for the IMP must be used where the IMP is unlicensed (i.e. it does not have a marketing authorisation).  Where the IMP being used is licensed, but is being used outside of its licensed indication, an IB should be used where available and should be supplied from the collaborating pharmaceutical company, if they are supplying the drug. Otherwise it is acceptable to use the latest SmPC. Where a generic IMP is to be used one comprehensive SmPC should be chosen at time of request for a CTA for use in the trial for the purposes of pharmacovigilance monitoring only; for any other information regarding a generic IMP, the site should be instructed to refer to the relevant manufacturer’s SmPC and ensure that a copy of this is saved in the Investigator Site File.  -->
<!-- The Reference Safety Information (RSI) that is used for pharmacovigilance purposes is used to assess the expectedness of events and will be checked by the sponsor for changes on the anniversary of the issue date of the reference safety information. A statement should be included in the protocol describing which document is approved for use within the trial for pharmacovigilance monitoring (it is best not to include the IB / SmPC as an appendix to the protocol, as a protocol amendment would be required if the IB / SmPC is updated).  -->
<!-- Routinely breaking the blind in double blind trials could compromise the integrity of the trial. It is important to separate out emergency unblinding (section 7.5) and unblinding for expedited reporting to authorities. For this reason the protocol should state that breaking the blind will only take place where information about the participant’s trial treatment is clearly necessary for the appropriate medical management of the participant. In all cases the Investigator would be anticipated to evaluate the causality and expectedness of SAEs as though the participant was receiving the active medication. -->

<!-- Aim: to describe the recording and reporting of SAEs, SARs  AND SUSARs  -->
<!-- The period of time over which AEs, ARs, SAEs, SARs and SUSARs must be recorded and reported must be clearly stated in the protocol. The point where recording / reporting usually starts is: -->
<!--     • For AEs / SAEs – consent -->
<!--     • For ARs / SARs and SUSARs – 1st IMP dose -->
<!-- The point where recording / reporting ends is based on the regulatory requirements, intervention and the trial design and the following should be considered in making this decision: -->

<!--     • The active monitoring period for (S)ARs should be defined based on the amount of information available regarding how long the IMP remains active in the participant, how long it may remain active / inactive in the participant and potentially be transferable to a foetus, how long it takes for (S)ARs to peak (e.g. is there an anticipated cumulative effect of dosing and when is this likely to occur), known late effects (e.g. secondary malignancies that will require active monitoring). It is not acceptable to simply state that SAEs will be actively monitored for 30 days post last treatment without justification.  -->
<!--     • following the active monitoring period (when the participant has finished treatment and the active monitoring period has ended) investigators are still required to report any SARs or SUSARs that they become aware of.  -->
<!--     • Safety reporting periods for SAEs and SARs must be equal across all arms of a randomised trial to prevent any bias in reporting. -->
<!-- Where a participant withdraws consent for further processing of data, this does not preclude the reporting of SARs and SUSARs which are required to continue being reported according to the protocol for regulatory purposes. The PIS should include a section explaining this to the participant.  -->

<!-- This section should detail the methods used for the determination of the sample size and a reference to tables or statistical software used to carry out the calculation. Sufficient information should be provided so that the sample size calculation can be reproduced. -->
<!-- For trials that involve a formal sample size calculation, the guiding principle is that the planned sample size should be large enough to have a high probability (power) of detecting a true effect of a given magnitude, should it exist. Sample size calculations are generally based on one primary outcome; however, it may also be worthwhile to plan for adequate trial power or report the power that will be available (given the proposed sample size) for other important outcomes or analyses because trials are often underpowered to detect harms or subgroup effects. -->
<!-- If the planned sample size is not derived statistically, then this should be explicitly stated along with a rationale for the intended sample size (e.g., exploratory nature of pilot studies; pragmatic considerations for trials in rare diseases). -->
<!-- Formal sample size calculations typically require the power to be specified and the following values with justification: -->
<!--     • Treatment Effect or Alternative Hypothesis: is this the smallest size of effect that would be of clinical interest- how is this justified in the form of appropriate references, pilot data or clinical arguments.  -->
<!--     • null Hypothesis: A clear statement of the hypothesis, in terms of numerical values, of the treatment being ineffective. For example: an absolute difference in response rates between arms of zero.  -->

<!--     • significance level: what risk is acceptable of concluding the treatment is effective, when in reality the treatment is ineffective.  -->
<!--     • In trials with continuous outcomes the standard deviation of the primary endpoint should be included: if previous studies or literature are used to estimate or justify the assumptions made to determine this parameter, or any other parameters relevant to the design (e.g. dropout rate, noncompliance rates median survival rate, response rate), provide references.  -->

<!-- Source Data -->
<!-- ICH E6 section 1.51, defines source data as "All information in original records and certified copies of original records or clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial. Source data are contained in source documents (original records or certified copies)." -->
<!-- The basic concept of source data is that it permits not only reporting and analysis but also verification at various steps in the process for the purposes of confirmation, quality control, audit or inspection. A number of attributes are considered of universal importance to source data and the records that hold those data. These include that the data and records are:  -->
<!--     • Accurate  -->
<!--     • Legible  -->
<!--     • Contemporaneous  -->
<!--     • Original  -->

<!--     • Attributable  -->
<!--     • Complete  -->
<!--     • Consistent  -->
<!--     • Enduring  -->
<!--     • Available when needed  -->
<!-- Source Documents -->
<!-- ICH E6 1.52, defines source documents as "Original documents, data and records (e.g., hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, participants' diaries of evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies or transcriptions certified after verification as being accurate and complete, microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x-rays, participant files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico-technical departments involved in the clinical trial)." -->
<!-- Case report forms -->
<!-- A case report form (CRF) is a form on which individual patient data required by the trial protocol are recorded. It may be a printed or electronic document (eCRF). The CRF data is used to perform statistical analysis for the trial. Design of individual CRFs will vary from trial to trial, but it is essential that the design ensures that: -->
<!--     • adequate collection of data has been performed -->
<!--     • proper audit trails can be kept to demonstrate the validity of the trial (both during and after the trial) -->
<!--     • only the data required by the protocol are captured in the CRF (using the CRF to capture secondary data not required for the trial may be a criminal beach of the Data Protection Act, makes the CRF unnecessarily complicated, and can make it more difficult to extract the primary data for analysis) -->
<!-- CRFs as Source Documents -->
<!-- If the protocol allows data to be entered directly onto the case report forms (CRF), the CRF would then be considered a source document. If the CRF is then transmitted to the sponsor, it is necessary for the trial site to retain a copy to ensure that the PI has an independent account from the sponsor as to what has occurred during the trial at his/her site. Additional information can be found in ICH E6, section 6.4.9. -->
<!-- Guidance can be found here: http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Regulatory_and_procedural_guideline/2010/08/WC500095754.pdf -->
<!-- The protocol should: -->

<!--     • the protocol and trial conduct will comply with the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004 and any relevant amendments -->
<!--     • For trials using ionising radiation the protocol should state that: -->
<!--         ◦ the procedures are compliant with the Ionising Radiation (Medical Exposure) Regulations, and appropriate review by a Medical Physics Expert and Clinical Radiation Expert has been undertaken, and -->
<!--         ◦ Where a trial involves the administration of radioactive substances the protocol should clearly identify that a current Administration of Radioactive Substances Advisory Committee (ARSAC) certificate will be required for each site and, where exposures are additional to normal standard of care, a research ARSAC certificate will be required for each site -->
<!-- NB Ionising radiation includes: -->
<!--     • X-rays, CT scans, DXA scans -->
<!--     • Radiotherapy (including brachytherapy and radionuclide therapy, using unsealed sources) -->
<!--     • Radionuclide studies (including nuclear medicine imaging, PET-CT and in vitro measurements) -->
<!--     • Administration of a radioactive substance -->
<!-- Neither MRI nor ultrasound involve ionising radiation. -->
<!-- There is a legal and ethical need to justify the use of ionising radiation in research protocols. Be aware that the Ionising Radiation (Medical Exposure) Regulations relate to any research exposure, not only to those additional to routine clinical care.  -->
<!-- Procedures involving administration of radioactive material to participants, which differ from standard of care, must be covered by an appropriate ARSAC certificate. Procedures might include: -->
<!--     • Radionucleotide imaging -->
<!--     • MUGA scans -->
<!--     • Brachytherapy -->
<!-- ARSAC certificates are specific to the site, procedure and purpose (diagnosis, treatment, or research) of the administration. Under the current ARSAC arrangements, a research ARSAC certificate is only needed at a site where the administration required by a research protocol is additional to that which participants would receive under routine clinical care at that site (routine procedures will be covered by existing diagnostic or treatment ARSAC certificates held by a certificate holder at the site). Currently research ARSAC certificates are trial specific, so each site will need to apply for a research ARSAC certificate for each trial that involves administration additional to routine clinical care.   -->
<!-- Special consideration should be given to potential variation in procedure at sites; what might be routine at one site could be additional to routine care at another site. Also, care should be taken where the protocol gives sites an option on the testing method, for example heart function may be determined either by echocardiogram or MUGA scan. Sites may intend to use echocardiograms, so not apply for a research ARSAC certificate to cover the MUGA scans, but this would leave them in a difficult position if, due to practical reasons, they were unable to use echocardiograms (e.g. equipment failure, scheduling issues) to perform the tests required by the protocol. -->
<!-- All imaging technologies have the potential to uncover previously unknown pathology.  You should always consider how likely such a discovery may be, and how best to handle this discovery when developing research protocols that involve any imaging techniques. -->
<!-- The protocol should state that: -->
<!--     • Before any site can enrol patients into the study, the Chief Investigator/Principal Investigator or designee will ensure that appropriate approvals from participating organisations are in place. Specific arrangements on how to gain approval from participating organisations are in place and comply with the relevant guidance. Different arrangements for NHS and non NHS sites are described as relevant. -->
<!--     • For any amendment to the study, the Chief Investigator or designee, in agreement with the sponsor will submit information to the appropriate body in order for them to issue approval for the amendment. The Chief Investigator or designee will work with sites (R&D departments at NHS sites as well as the study delivery team) so they can put the necessary arrangements in place to implement the amendment to confirm their support for the study as amended. -->
