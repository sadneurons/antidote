    "text": "Background\nDelirium is a syndrome of disturbed alertness, orientation and arousal, complicated by neuropsychiatric abnormalities like paranoia and hallucinations. A single episode of delirium may permanently damage cognition(1) and increases the risk of dementia 3-fold over the following 3 years(2). Delirium is more common in older people and occurs in 20% of hospital inpatients and 40% of postoperative surgical patients, including those undergoing hip repair(3). Up to 90% of those who fracture their hip have underlying abnormalities in biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease (rising to 98% in those with known mild cognitive problems)(4).\nIn the UK, 65,000 people fracture their hip every year(3). On average, 7% of these people will die within a month of their fracture. Postoperative delirium doubles the risk of death in the 12 months after fracture(5), especially if superimposed on pre-existing dementia(6). So, hip fracture is a major public health concern, both hastening dementia onset and causing premature death in those living with dementia. There is currently no treatment that prevents or shortens the duration of delirium, and no promising candidate. Delirium is often treated by addressing the underlying contributors (e.g. infection, pain, sedating medicines) and using sensitive nursing practice and clear communication. This can improve outcomes. However, after hip surgery, delirium impairs the early mobilisation and engagement with physiotherapy vital for good postoperative outcomes in dementia, like mobility and discharge to your own home."

    "text": "Review of existing evidence\nPre-clinical: IL-1 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine pivotal to the earliest stages of inflammatory response(7). It induces IL-6 and IL-8 gene expression and promotes lymphocyte differentiation and cellular immune response. The most prevalent preclinical model of delirium uses injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to switch on the inflammatory cascade. IL-1 in isolation can mimic the cognitive effects of LPS in this model(8). Blockade of IL-1 action using recombinant receptor antagonists prevents the pro-inflammatory effects of LPS in these animal models of delirium(8). Thus, blockade of this early, amplifying step in the pro-inflammatory cytokine cascade may prevent cognitive deterioration.\nClinical: In humans, IL-1 is a key driver of neuroinflammation after hip fracture, with raised CSF and serum levels(9).\nAnakinra is a specific IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) already in use for patients with autoimmune disease including arthritis and those with critical lung disease due to COVID. It is an analogue of the naturally produced human IL1 receptor antagonist.\nAim The aim of the research is to examine whether Anakinra can reduce the incidence of delirium post hip repair in older people. Anakinra is an interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist licensed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. It is given subcutaneously twice daily, ideal for inpatients with delirium who may not be able to take oral medications. We will conduct a double-blind randomised controlled trial of Anakinra in older people after hip fracture.\nObjectives The objectives, in priority order, are to compare subcutaneous Anakinra to placebo given twice daily during the perioperative period in terms of: 1. (1°) Severity of delirium postoperatively as measured by the XXXXXXXX 2. (2°) Time to first weight bearing postoperatively 3. (3°) Time until medically fit for discharge postoperatively 4. (3°) Safety of Anakinra during the perioperative period and in wound healing 5. (3°) Tolerability of Anakinra versus placebo in terms of common side effects 6. (3°) Effect of Anakinra on 30-day mortality\nInclusion criteria: 1. Fracture of the hip radiologically confirmed 2. Age > 64 3. Capacity to give informed consent or has relative or caregiver able to give informed consent\nExclusion criteria: 1. Lack of a study partner or caregiver 2. Active infection 3. History of hypersensitivity to or unacceptable side effects of Anakinra 4. Current substance misuse 5. Active malignancy 6. Acute stroke or TIA 7. Currently participating in clinical trial of an investigational medicinal product (CTIMP) 8. Women of child-bearing potential 9. Neutropenia of any cause.\nOversight: The conduct of the study will be overseen by a Study Steering Committee. All events (Adverse events (AEs) serious adverse events (SAEs)) will be scrutinised by an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC).\nSetting and recruitment: Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester. Participants will be recruited from those presenting to local emergency departments with hip fracture. Where participants lack decision-making capacity to give informed consent, the consent of a caregiver or relative will be sought."

    "text": "Minimum clinically significant difference\nThe minmum clinically significant difference in any of the candidate delirium scales is not well established in the literature. It is clear that preventing cases of delirium will have significant positive economic outcomes for the NHS. Therefore, it would be possible to reason backwards from utilities to a minimum number of prevented cases. However, it is not clear that a reduction in the severity of delirium is associated with a shorter duration of delirium (intuitively appealing as that may be). It is also not clear that a reduction in the severity of delirium is associated with a shorter hospital stay per se, because no treatment has been found which effectively reduces severity. Therefore, we have chosen measures which seek to measure the primary outcome - delirium severity, and measure as secondary outcomes important clinical endpoints such as time-to-stand and time to medical fitness-for-discharge, because there are many confounding postoperative factors apart from delirium which might influence their outcome, signfiicantly lowering the signal-noise ratio."

    "text": "Frequentist simulation\nAssumption:: Delirium rating scales are ordinal measures, not interval measures (a person scoring 4 is not half as delirious as someone scoring 8)\nSolution: Ordinal logistic regression does not assume interval scales, nor normal distributions of the scores. It does make a proportional-odds assumption testable using the parallel test. The coefficients can be interpreted as the log-odds of a one point increase in the scale score, \\(y\\), with a one point (or one unit) increase in the predictor variable \\(x\\).\nAssumption: While delirium is by its nature a fluctuating condition, we assume there will be correlation within participants in delirium scale scores over time.\nSolution: Mixed effects models will allow for an autoregressive correlation structure and regularisation of the model. Frequentist ordinal logistic mixed models are facilitated by R packages ‘ordinal’ and ‘rms’ and Bayesian mixed effects ordinal regression models are facilitated by packages ‘brms’ (with cumulative log-odds link function) and ‘rmsb’. These have been used in simulation below.\nAssumption: There may be significant anaesthetic methods (spinal/GA) in those presenting to the ED with hip fractures. The descriptive statistics for Wythenshawe hospital can be found below.\nSolution Because the nature of the anaesthetic (spinal versus general) may relate to the nature of the participants’ comorbidities and the presence or absence of preoperative delirium, we will use a minimisation strategy to ensure equal numbers of spinal and general anaesthetic procedures in each trial arm. The numbers of participants having GA will vary month-month.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Download R data object (.rds)\n\n\n\nThis can be modelled using a restricted cubic spline function with \\(k = 3\\) knots, in order to estimate the month to month variation (rather than including the variation over years). However, it is also clear that we would expect the percentage of participants receiving general anaesthetics to decrease over the 24-month duration of the trial if it started now.\n\n\nLinear Regression Model\n \n rms::ols(formula = `General anaesthetic %` ~ rcs(days, 3), data = wyhipsurg)\n \n                  Model Likelihood    Discrimination    \n                        Ratio Test           Indexes    \n Obs      134    LR chi2     76.22    R2       0.434    \n sigma11.6048    d.f.            2    R2 adj   0.425    \n d.f.     131    Pr(> chi2) 0.0000    g       11.533    \n \n Residuals\n \n      Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n -28.2919  -7.6429   0.8064   8.3643  27.4490 \n \n \n           Coef    S.E.   t      Pr(>|t|)\n Intercept 42.3887 2.7708  15.30 <0.0001 \n days       0.0219 0.0023   9.50 <0.0001 \n days'     -0.0286 0.0029 -10.00 <0.0001 \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe thus have a predicted trial starting percentage of GA cases of 44.3% and a month-month variation (sd of residuals of ols model using restricted cubic spline) of 11.52%.\nAssumption: There may be significant variation in time to operation in those presenting to the ED with hip fractures.

Signatures 18\nREFERENCES 19\n\nBackground & Rationale\nThis should comprise a brief description of the proposed study, a description of the population to be studied, the investigational product(s), device(s) or radiation exposure, a summary of findings from non-clinical studies that potentially have clinical significance, and from previous clinical trials that are relevant to the trial. A summary of the known and potential risks and benefits to human participants should be presented, together with a justification for the choice of route of administration, dosage, dosage regimen, and treatment period(s). This should be supported by appropriate references to the published literature on the disease or condition, its treatment and the use of the study drug for the indication. Data from previous studies as well as any other information that provides background for the trial should be cited.\nTrial Objectives and Design\n\nTrial Objectives\nThis should comprise specific statements of the purpose (i.e. aims and objectives) of the study, together with a definition of the primary (and secondary) endpoints of the study.\n\nPrimary endpoints\nSecondary endpoints\nPrimary and secondary endpoints/outcomes will be measured to determine the study objectives. An ideal endpoint/outcome is valid, reproducible, relevant to the target population, and responsive to changes in the health condition being studied.\n\n\nFor each endpoint/outcome, the trial protocol should define four components:\nthe specific measurement variable, which corresponds to the data collected directly from trial participants (e.g. all-cause mortality);\nthe participant-level analysis metric, which corresponds to the format of the outcome data that will be used from each trial participant for analysis (e.g., change from baseline, final value, time to event);\nthe method of aggregation, which refers to the summary measure format for each trial group (e.g., mean, proportion with score > 2);\nthe specific measurement time point of interest for analysis\n\nTrial Design\nA description of the design of trial to be conducted (e.g. double-blind, single-blind, open label, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, double-dummy, cross-over, etc.) should be given.\n\n\n\nTrial Flowchart\nPlease include a time/event matrix (flow chart) of trial procedures and stages. Ensure all trial procedures at all stages are captured (cross check with section 7 Trial Procedures and the study endpoints). Visit windows for each visit are highly recommended to avoid protocol deviations. Key information to convey includes the timing of all trial activity, starting from initial eligibility screening, each trial visit through to trial close-out and long term follow-up; time periods during which trial interventions will be administered; and the procedures and assessments performed at each visit (e.g. blood tests or scans, treatment, diary completion, adverse event monitoring, physical examination etc.).\n\n\n\n\n\nScreening\nBaseline\nVisit 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWritten informed consent\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEligibility assessment\nX\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRandomisation (if applicable)\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIMP administration\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\n\n\nAdverse events\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\n\n\n\nTrial Medication\n\nInvestigational Medicinal Product\nProvide a description of the trial treatment, (specify the brand or manufacturer of drug & supplier) including placebo and comparator drugs. Include a description of the dosage form, packaging, and labelling of the product(s). Provide details of how the IMP will be dispensed and who provides the IMP in multi-centre trials e.g. supplied locally or centrally from CI site.\n\n\nDepending whether the trial is a Type A or a Type B/C the statement regarding the label will be different for example (select or delete as applicable):\nTrial-specific labelling is not required where the IMP:\n• has a marketing authorisation in the UK, and\n• is being used within the terms of its marketing authorisation, and\n• is dispensed to a trial participant in accordance with a prescription given by an authorised healthcare professional and is labelled in accordance with the requirements of Schedule 5 to the Medicines for Human Use (SI 1994/3194) (Marketing Authorisations Etc) Regulations 1994 that apply in relation to dispensed relevant medicinal products.\nAs this is a Type A trial, with no higher risk to the participant than standard of care, and the trial will use commercially available IMP with no modifications and which will be used in accordance with the SmPC, no additional labelling is required.\nOR\nThe information presented on the IMP labels will be annex 13 compliant.* 1. ## Dosing Regimen Specify the route of administration, dosage and dosage regimen of all medicinal products (or devices) under investigation. It is necessary to define the expected duration of participant participation, and to describe the sequence and duration of all trial periods (e.g. “wash-out”, “treatment”, “follow-up” etc). It is also very important to define any special dietary or “life-style” requirements that will be imposed (e.g. no smoking or no alcohol to be drunk within a specified time prior to, and until a specified time after, each dose; a low fat or high fat diet, a specified interval of starvation between doses etc). 1. ## IMP Risks Identify which document is to be the Reference Document – i.e. Investigators Brochure for non-licensed products and Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for marketed products. List all of the risks including special precautions and contra-indications. These will/can be linked to the IMP safety assessments detailed in section 9.1 and indicate how the risks will be mitigated. 1. ## Drug Accountability Specify the process for drug returns and accountability (if applicable) – if no drug accountability is required (such as type A trial) then specify why it is not required (e.g. standard care). 1. ## Storage of IMP Describe storage requirements of IMP (detailed in IB or SmPC) and how these will be monitored (if applicable). 1. ## Participant Compliance State here the procedures for determining compliance with medication (this can be pill counts or weighing ointment tubes at stipulated visits, or by participants completing diaries, or by specific blood tests being performed at specified clinic visits etc). 1. ## Concomitant Medication Describe what (if any) medications or treatments will be permitted concurrently with the study medication. Also stipulate those drugs or therapies that will not be permitted during treatment with the study medication(s). The section should also include reference to any rescue medication that may be prescribed (usually in placebo-controlled trials in which the population randomly assigned to receive placebo medication would reasonably be expected to require “relief of symptoms” that will not be achieved with placebo medication).\ne.g.:\nFor management of concomitant therapies, please refer to the xxx Summary of Product Characteristics or Investigators Brochure (delete as applicable) A complete listing of all concomitant medication received during the treatment phase must be recorded in the relevant CRF.\nIf the protocol includes a drug that is taken by all trial participants i.e. it is an inclusion criterion that all participants must be taking a specific prescription medication prior to study entry or a specific drug that is not the IMP will be given to all trial participants, this should be listed as a NIMP.\nIf you require participants to follow specific contraception requirements the acceptable methods can be added in this section (make sure they are referenced in exclusion criteria). 1. # Selection and Withdrawal of Participants 1. ## Inclusion Criteria This section should contain details of age, sex, disease, prior treatment constraints etc., under which a participant is deemed to be suitable (eligible) to participate in the trial. This also includes healthy volunteers and any “control” groups etc. Each such “group” should be defined separately. Informed consent to participate (preferably written and witnessed) must be stated as an inclusion criterion. A simple list format is the preferred style. 1. ## Exclusion Criteria This section should contain details of age, sex, disease, prior treatment constraints etc., under which a participant is considered to be unsuitable for inclusion into the study population. (Examples frequently include exposure to prior radiotherapy in cancer trials, and participation in a trial with an investigational product within the previous three months in pharmacokinetics trials). A simple list format is the preferred style.\nIt should be stated if pregnant or lactating females and women of child bearing potential will be excluded and suitable methods of contraception specified if applicable. Highly effective methods of birth control are defined as those, alone or in combination, that result in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. For participants using a hormonal contraceptive method, information regarding the product under evaluation and its potential effect on the contraceptive should be addressed.\n\nGuidance on the acceptable contraception methods can be found here:\n\n*http://www.hma.eu/fileadmin/dateien/Human_Medicines/01-About_HMA/Working_Groups/CTFG/2014_09_HMA_CTFG_Contraception.pdf*\n\nIf pre-trial results are accepted for eligibility assessment, then specify how long these results are valid before screening (add this to individual eligibility criteria).\nExclusion criteria should include risk populations and any contraindications identified in section 5.3 and as listed in the SmPC/ IB.\n\nSelection of Participants\nState where participants will be recruited from, i.e. from clinic or referred from GP surgeries/other hospitals, PIC sites etc.\n\n\n\nConsent\nThe Principal Investigator (PI) retains overall responsibility for the conduct of research at their site, this includes the taking of informed consent of participants at their site. They must ensure that any person delegated responsibility to participate in the informed consent process is duly authorised, trained and competent to participate according to the ethically approved protocol, principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and Declaration of Helsinki. If delegation of consent is acceptable then details should be provided.\n\nInformed consent must be obtained prior to the participant undergoing procedures that are specifically for the purposes of the trial and are out-with standard routine care at the participating site (including the collection of identifiable participant data unless the trial has prior approval from the Confidentiality Advisory Group (CAG) and the Research Ethics Committee (REC)). Provide details of the consent procedure for participants.\n\nRandomisation Procedure / Code Break\nProvide details of the randomisation procedure to be used for each participant and where/how code break will be achieved if necessary – delete if treatment is not randomised/blinded\n\nPlease specify how study numbers will be allocated. 1. #### Randomisation Randomisation service will be provided by (insert details of randomisation service if applicable) 1. #### Emergency Code Break Whilst the safety of participants in the trial must always take priority, maintenance of blinding is crucial to the integrity of the trial. Investigators should only break the blind when information about the participant ’s trial treatment is clearly necessary for the appropriate medical management of the participant and where stopping the blinded medication is not sufficient.\nShould an alternative to unblinding not be identified, and if unblinding is required to optimise medical management of the participant, investigators should follow the emergency unblinding process below.\n24hr Emergency Code Break and Medical Information will be provided by (insert details of code break service if applicable) Each randomised participant will be provided with a card detailing code break telephone numbers and emergency contact details. Participants will be requested to carry this card with them at all times whilst participating in the trial. 1. ## Withdrawal of Participants Please provide details of when and how to withdraw participants from the trial or investigational product treatment. It is essential that you specify the type and timing of the data to be collected for withdrawn participants and indicate whether (and if so, how) withdrawn participants are to be replaced, as well as arrangements for safety assessment follow-up of any participants withdrawn from trial treatment as the result of (Serious) Adverse Events. Also include if participants will be withdrawn due to poor compliance and what the rules for this are e.g.\nStudy drug must be discontinued if:\n\nthe participant misses xx consecutive courses of treatment\nthe participant decides they no longer wish to continue\nrecommended by the investigator\n\nParticipants have the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. The investigator also has the right to withdraw participants from the study drug in the event of inter-current illness, AEs, SAEs, SUSARs, protocol violations, cure, administrative reasons or other reasons. It is understood by all concerned that an excessive rate of withdrawals can render the study un-interpretable; therefore, unnecessary withdrawal of participants should be avoided. Should a participant decide to withdraw from the study, all efforts will be made to report the reason for withdrawal as thoroughly as possible. Should a participant withdraw from study drug only, efforts will be made to continue to obtain follow-up data, with the permission of the participant.\n– delete or amend as applicable\ne.g. Participants who wish to withdraw from trial medication (IMP) will be asked to confirm whether they are still willing to provide the following:\n\ntrial specific data at visits xxx\nxxx data collected as per routine clinical practice at visits xxx\n\nWithdrawn participants will/ will not be replaced. amend as applicable 1. ## Expected Duration of Trial Specify the expected clinical participation and define the end of the trial. This can be the full study duration e.g. first participant first visit to last participant last visit including follow up. Alternatively, for long running oncology studies, the end of trial can be defined as a set time point at which the study will be regarded as completed even if participants are still in follow up. Please note the definition of the end of the trial will determine the timelines for submitting the Clinical Study Report i.e. within 12 months from the end of the trial as per protocol definition. Therefore, you should ensure that the end of trial definition enables you can comply with the regulatory timelines for Clinical Study Report submission.\ne.g. The end of trial will be defined as last participant last visit, each individual participant will remain on trial until xxxxxxxxxx. 1. # Trial Procedures 1. By Visit\nDescribe the sequence of procedures to be performed at each visit as detailed in the time/event flowchart in section.2.3. Please ensure all study procedures and time points are included and consistent with the flowchart. 1. ## Laboratory Tests Detail any laboratory measurements required (standard of care and study specific), detailing any handling, storage and packaging instructions. Include details of the Lab conducting analysis. Study specific activities (collection, handling, shipment, analysis) (if details are provided in a laboratory/pathology manual there is no requirement to duplicate information in the protocol) 1. # Assessment of Efficacy 1. ## Efficacy Parameters Describe the measures that will be used to determine the efficacy of treatment (e.g. glucose, blood pressure, tumour reduction etc.). Primary efficacy parameters should be stated first (section 8.1.1), then any secondary parameters (section 8.2.1) 1. #### Primary Efficacy Parameters 1. #### Secondary Efficacy Parameters 1. ## Procedures for Assessing Efficacy Parameters Describe here the procedures (and their time points) for determining the primary and secondary efficacy parameters (e.g. venepuncture, 25 ml to be drawn 12 hrs post treatment for full blood count, SMAC and glucose, or CT scan at 6 months, etc). State also here what is to be recorded in the CRF (e.g. WBC, Hb, Urea, Glucose etc. rather than “FBC” or “SMAC”) – i.e. stipulate the parameters that are actually to be used for the analysis of efficacy. (See also Safety Parameters 9.1 below) 1. # Assessment of Safety 1. ## Specification, Timing and Recording of Safety Parameters Describe the measures that will be used to determine participant safety during the study. These will include physical examination, blood tests and adverse event reporting. Obviously, there will be close correlation with efficacy testing intervals and efficacy blood tests etc. In this section the tests that to be performed for assessing the safety of the participant should be appropriate to the treatment (e.g. WBC and platelets in chemotherapy, LFTs if there is a known or suspected risk of hepatotoxicity, U&Es if there is a risk of renal problems etc.), although “general” assessments from FBC or SMAC would be acceptable. As with efficacy measures, please stipulate (i.e. repeat even if given above) the times at which safety evaluations will be conducted (Please do not write “see above” in this section; please copy & paste from 4.3 as and where appropriate).\nThe safety assessments will be relative to those risks identified in section 5.3 if high populations at risk identified in SmPC are not excluded from participation then detail the mitigating factors and extra safety measures in this section.\nPlease also define the period for AE reporting – e.g. consent or randomisation until final visit, 30 days post final IMP administration, etc. If AEs are not being reported from consent, a rationale and justification for this approach must be included in the protocol. 1. ## Procedures for Recording and Reporting Adverse Events The Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004 and Amended Regulations 2006 gives the following definitions:\n\nAdverse Event (AE): Any untoward medical occurrence in a participant to whom a medicinal product has been administered, including occurrences which are not necessarily caused by or related to that product.\nAdverse Reaction (AR): Any untoward and unintended response in a participant to an investigational medicinal product which is related to any dose administered to that participant.\nUnexpected Adverse Reaction (UAR): An adverse reaction the nature and severity of which is not consistent with the information about the medicinal product in question set out in:\n\nThe summary of product characteristics (SmPC) for that product (for products with a marketing authorisation) select or delete as applicable\nThe Investigator’s Brochure (IB) relating to the trial in question (for any other investigational product) select or delete as applicable\n\nSerious adverse Event (SAE), Serious Adverse Reaction (SAR) or Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR): Any adverse event, adverse reaction or unexpected adverse reaction, respectively, that:\nresults in death;\nis life-threatening;\nrequired hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation;\nresults in persistent or significant disability or incapacity;\nconsists of a congenital anomaly or birth defect.\nImportant Medical Events (IME) & Pregnancy: Events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalisation but may jeopardise the participant or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above should also be considered serious. Although not a serious adverse event, any unplanned pregnancy will also be reported via the SAE reporting system.\n\nReporting Responsibilities (review and amend highlighted areas as applicable)\n[Add Sponsor organisations] have delegated the delivery of the Sponsor’s responsibility for Pharmacovigilance (as defined in Regulation 5 of the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004 to the King’s Health Partners Clinical Trials Office (KHP-CTO).\nSelect agreed reporting route or detail the reporting structure for this trial\nAll SAEs, SARs and SUSARs (excepting those specified in this protocol as not requiring reporting) will be reported immediately by the Chief Investigator (and certainly no later than 24hrs) to the KHP-CTO in accordance with the current Pharmacovigilance Policy.\nOR\nAll SAEs, SARs and SUSARs (excepting those specified in this protocol as not requiring reporting) will be reported immediately (and certainly no later than 24hrs) by the Investigator to the KHP-CTO and CI for review in accordance with the current Pharmacovigilance Policy.\nThe below wording is optional but may be applicable in some trials:\nDeath as a result of disease progression and other events that are primary or secondary outcome measures are not considered to be SAEs and should be reported in the normal way, on the appropriate CRF.\nThe KHP-CTO will report SUSARs to the regulatory authorities (MHRA, competent authorities of other EEA (European Economic Area) states in which the trial is taking place.\nThe Chief Investigator will report to the relevant ethics committee. Reporting timelines are as follows:\n\nSUSARs which are fatal or life-threatening must be reported not later than 7 days after the sponsor is first aware of the reaction. Any additional relevant information must be reported within a further 8 days;\nSUSARs that are not fatal or life-threatening must be reported within 15 days of the sponsor first becoming aware of the reaction.\n\nThe Chief Investigator and KHP-CTO (on behalf of the co-sponsors), will submit a Development Safety Update Report (DSUR) relating to this trial IMP, to the MHRA and REC annually. 1. ## Adverse events that do not require reporting Define here any AEs or SAEs that are expected and do not require reporting for this trial. For trials where the IMP is licensed, it is permissible to state that events or reactions listed in the SmPC do not need to be reported. Please do not state that only ARs/SARs/SUSARs will be reported but only exclude some expected events that will not be required for the final analysis. 1. ## Premature Termination of the Trial Define rules e.g.\nThe trial may be prematurely discontinued by the Sponsor, Chief Investigator or Regulatory Authority on the basis of new safety information or for other reasons given by the Data Monitoring & Ethics Committee / Trial Steering Committee regulatory authority or ethics committee concerned.\nIf the trial is prematurely discontinued, active participants will be informed and no further participant data will be collected. The Competent Authority and Research Ethics Committee will be informed within 15 days of the early termination of the trial. 1. # Statistics A description of the measures taken to avoid (or at least minimize) bias should be given. 1. ## Sample Size The number of participants to be enrolled should be stated, together with the rationale for the sample size (the “power calculation”). 1. ## Randomisation Describe statistical basis of the randomisation (e.g. stratified etc.) and blinding. Details of randomisation process to be included in section 6.4. 1. ## Analysis Include summary of the statistical analysis plan (SAP) in this section - a description of the statistical methods to be employed, including timing of any planned interim analyses should also be provided The level of significance that is to be used in each trial analysis must be stipulated, together with the procedure(s) for accounting for any missing, unused, and spurious data. Procedures for reporting any deviation from the original statistical plan should be described and justified. The data set for any analysis must be clearly stipulated (e.g. “all participants”, “randomised participants”, “intent to treat”) and the population(s) should be clearly defined. Define the treatment stopping rules if appropriate. Depending on the complexity of the trial, there may be a separate SAP document. 1. # Trial Steering Committee Delete this section if no steering committee is to be set up. Detail composition and function of the Committee (if used). The Committee Chair should be independent (i.e. not a co-investigator). Lay members or participant population representatives are desirable. 1. # Data Monitoring Committee Delete this section if no monitoring committee is to be set up. Detail composition and function of the Committee (i.e. to assess trial progress, occurrence of adverse events and all other aspects). Details of how often the committee will meet and its composition should be listed in the Data Monitoring Committee charter. 1. # Direct Access to Source Data and Documents It will be specified (or reference is made to another written agreement) that the investigator(s) and the institution(s) will permit trial-related monitoring, audits, REC review, and regulatory inspections (where appropriate) by providing direct access to source data and other documents (i.e. participants’ case sheets, blood test reports, X-ray reports, histology reports etc).\ne.g.\nThe Investigator(s) will permit trial-related monitoring, audits, REC review, and regulatory inspections by providing the Sponsor(s), Regulators and REC direct access to source data and other documents (e.g. participants’ case sheets, blood test reports, X-ray reports, histology reports etc.). 1. # Ethics & Regulatory Approvals A statement that the trial will be conducted in compliance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki 199), the principles of GCP and all of the applicable regulatory requirements (specify current legislation) is essential. If possible state the name and address of the REC to which the study protocol and other documentation will be submitted (e.g. Liverpool Adult Research Ethics Committee or Liverpool Children’s Research Ethics Committee). You should also state that any subsequent protocol amendments will submitted to the REC, HRA and Regulatory Authorities (as appropriate) for approval, and that you will comply with regulations, particularly specifying, Pharmacovigilance reporting and providing the REC & MHRA with progress reports, and a copy of the Final Study Report.\ne.g.\nThe trial will be conducted in compliance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (1996), the principles of GCP and in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements including but not limited to the Research Governance Framework and the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trial) Regulations 2004, as amended in 2006 and any subsequent amendments.\nThis protocol and related documents will be submitted for review to Health Research Authority (HRA), Research Ethics Committee (REC), and to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for Clinical Trial Authorisation.\nThe Chief Investigator will submit a final report at conclusion of the trial to the KHP-CTO (on behalf of the Sponsor) and the REC within the timelines defined in the Regulations. The KHP-CTO or delegate will upload the final report to a publicly registered database on behalf of the Sponsor.\n\nQuality Assurance\nGive details as to how QA will be maintained.\n\ne.g.\nMonitoring of this trial will be to ensure compliance with Good Clinical Practice and scientific integrity will be managed and oversight retained, by the KHP-CTO Quality Team. 1. # Data Handling Give details regarding the data handling procedures.\ne.g.\nThe Chief Investigator will act as custodian for the trial data. The following guidelines will be strictly adhered to: (amend as required)\n\nParticipant data will be pseudo-anonymised.\nAll pseudo-anonymised data will be stored on a password protected computer.\nAll trial data will be stored in line with the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Amended Regulations 2006 and the Data Protection Act and archived in line with the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Amended Regulations 2006 as defined in the Kings Health Partners Clinical Trials Office Archiving SOP.\n\n\nData Management\nGive details of whether paper or electronic CRF will be used, describe the proposed database etc. Depending on the complexity of the trial a Separate Data Management Plan may be required.\n\nCRFs as Source Documents\nIf the protocol allows data to be entered directly onto the case report forms (CRF), the CRF would then be considered a source document. If the CRF is then transmitted to the sponsor, it is necessary for the trial site to retain a copy to ensure that the PI has an independent account from the sponsor as to what has occurred during the trial at his/her site. Additional information can be found in ICH E6, section 6.4.9.\nGuidance can be found here: http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Regulatory_and_procedural_guideline/2010/08/WC500095754.pdf\nThe protocol should:\n• specify whether the data are from a standardised tool (e.g. McGill pain score) or involves a procedure (in which case full details should be supplied)\n• specify if a non standard tool is to be used, giving detail on its reliability and validity\n• describe the methods used to maximise completeness of data e.g. telephoning participants who have not returned postal questionnaires\n• specify that the investigator /institutions should keep records of all participants (sufficient information to link records e.g., CRFs, hospital records and samples), all original signed informed consent forms and copies of the CRF pages 1. # Publication Policy State how you intend to put the results of the trial into the public domain.\ne.g.\nIt is intended that the results of the study will be reported and disseminated at international conferences and in peer-reviewed scientific journals. 1. # Insurance / Indemnity Give details of the insurance/ indemnity arrangements for the trial.\n(Co-)Sponsor(s) insurance and indemnity schemes apply. 1. # Financial Aspects Describe how the trial is to be funded.\ne.g.\nFunding to conduct the trial is provided by XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n\nArchiving\n\nAt the end of this trial, all trial data will be stored in line with the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Amended Regulations 2006 and the 2018 Data Protection Act and archived in line with the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Amended Regulations 2006 as defined in the (Co)-Sponsor(s) Archiving Standard Operating Procedure (SOP).\n\nSignatures\nTo be signed by Chief Investigator minimum and statistician if applicable.\n\n______________________________________ _________________________\nChief Investigator Date\nPrint name\n ### REFERENCES** Protocol template v.8.1 25Feb2021 20"
