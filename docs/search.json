    "text": "Background\nDelirium is a syndrome of disturbed alertness, orientation and arousal, complicated by neuropsychiatric abnormalities like paranoia and hallucinations. A single episode of delirium may permanently damage cognition(1) and increases the risk of dementia 3-fold over the following 3 years(2). Delirium is more common in older people and occurs in 20% of hospital inpatients and 40% of postoperative surgical patients, including those undergoing hip repair(3). Up to 90% of those who fracture their hip have underlying abnormalities in biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease (rising to 98% in those with known mild cognitive problems)(4).\nIn the UK, 65,000 people fracture their hip every year(3). On average, 7% of these people will die within a month of their fracture. Postoperative delirium doubles the risk of death in the 12 months after fracture(5), especially if superimposed on pre-existing dementia(6). So, hip fracture is a major public health concern, both hastening dementia onset and causing premature death in those living with dementia. There is currently no treatment that prevents or shortens the duration of delirium, and no promising candidate. Delirium is often treated by addressing the underlying contributors (e.g. infection, pain, sedating medicines) and using sensitive nursing practice and clear communication. This can improve outcomes. However, after hip surgery, delirium impairs the early mobilisation and engagement with physiotherapy vital for good postoperative outcomes in dementia, like mobility and discharge to your own home.\n\nReview of existing evidence\nPre-clinical: IL-1 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine pivotal to the earliest stages of inflammatory response(7). It induces IL-6 and IL-8 gene expression and promotes lymphocyte differentiation and cellular immune response. The most prevalent preclinical model of delirium uses injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to switch on the inflammatory cascade. IL-1 in isolation can mimic the cognitive effects of LPS in this model(8). Blockade of IL-1 action using recombinant receptor antagonists prevents the pro-inflammatory effects of LPS in these animal models of delirium(8). Thus, blockade of this early, amplifying step in the pro-inflammatory cytokine cascade may prevent cognitive deterioration.\nClinical: In humans, IL-1 is a key driver of neuroinflammation after hip fracture, with raised CSF and serum levels(9).\nAnakinra is a specific IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) already in use for patients with autoimmune disease including arthritis and those with critical lung disease due to COVID. It is an analogue of the naturally produced human IL1 receptor antagonist.\nAim The aim of the research is to examine whether Anakinra can reduce the incidence of delirium post hip repair in older people. Anakinra is an interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist licensed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. It is given subcutaneously twice daily, ideal for inpatients with delirium who may not be able to take oral medications. We will conduct a double-blind randomised controlled trial of Anakinra in older people after hip fracture.\nObjectives The objectives, in priority order, are to compare subcutaneous Anakinra to placebo given twice daily during the perioperative period in terms of: 1. (1°) Severity of delirium postoperatively as measured by the XXXXXXXX 2. (2°) Time to first weight bearing postoperatively 3. (3°) Time until medically fit for discharge postoperatively 4. (3°) Safety of Anakinra during the perioperative period and in wound healing 5. (3°) Tolerability of Anakinra versus placebo in terms of common side effects 6. (3°) Effect of Anakinra on 30-day mortality\nInclusion criteria: 1. Fracture of the hip radiologically confirmed 2. Age > 64 3. Capacity to give informed consent or has relative or caregiver able to give informed consent\nExclusion criteria: 1. Lack of a study partner or caregiver 2. Active infection 3. History of hypersensitivity to or unacceptable side effects of Anakinra 4. Current substance misuse 5. Active malignancy 6. Acute stroke or TIA 7. Currently participating in clinical trial of an investigational medicinal product (CTIMP) 8. Women of child-bearing potential 9. Neutropenia of any cause.\nOversight: The conduct of the study will be overseen by a Study Steering Committee. All events (Adverse events (AEs) serious adverse events (SAEs)) will be scrutinised by an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC).\nSetting and recruitment: Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester. Participants will be recruited from those presenting to local emergency departments with hip fracture. Where participants lack decision-making capacity to give informed consent, the consent of a caregiver or relative will be sought.\n\n\nChoice of outcome measure\nTable\n\n\nMinimum clinically significant difference\nThe minmum clinically significant difference in any of the candidate delirium scales is not well established in the literature. It is clear that preventing cases of delirium will have significant positive economic outcomes for the NHS. Therefore, it would be possible to reason backwards from utilities to a minimum number of prevented cases. However, it is not clear that a reduction in the severity of delirium is associated with a shorter duration of delirium (intuitively appealing as that may be). It is also not clear that a reduction in the severity of delirium is associated with a shorter hospital stay per se, because no treatment has been found which effectively reduces severity. Therefore, we have chosen measures which seek to measure the primary outcome - delirium severity, and measure as secondary outcomes important clinical endpoints such as time-to-stand and time to medical fitness-for-discharge, because there are many confounding postoperative factors apart from delirium which might influence their outcome, signfiicantly lowering the signal-noise ratio.\n\n\nFrequentist simulation\nAssumption:: Delirium rating scales are ordinal measures, not interval measures (a person scoring 4 is not half as delirious as someone scoring 8)\nSolution: Ordinal logistic regression does not assume interval scales, nor normal distributions of the scores. It does make a proportional-odds assumption testable using the parallel test. The coefficients can be interpreted as the log-odds of a one point increase in the scale score, \\(y\\), with a one point (or one unit) increase in the predictor variable \\(x\\).\nAssumption: While delirium is by its nature a fluctuating condition, we assume there will be correlation within participants in delirium scale scores over time.\nSolution: Mixed effects models will allow for an autoregressive correlation structure and regularisation of the model. Frequentist ordinal logistic mixed models are facilitated by R packages ‘ordinal’ and ‘rms’ and Bayesian mixed effects ordinal regression models are facilitated by packages ‘brms’ (with cumulative log-odds link function) and ‘rmsb’. These have been used in simulation below.\nAssumption: There may be significant anaesthetic methods (spinal/GA) in those presenting to the ED with hip fractures. The descriptive statistics for Wythenshawe hospital can be found below.\nSolution Because the nature of the anaesthetic (spinal versus general) may relate to the nature of the participants’ comorbidities and the presence or absence of preoperative delirium, we will use a minimisation strategy to ensure equal numbers of spinal and general anaesthetic procedures in each trial arm. The numbers of participants having GA will vary month-month.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Download R data object (.rds)\n\n\n\nThis can be modelled using a restricted cubic spline function with \\(k = 3\\) knots, in order to estimate the month to month variation (rather than including the variation over years). However, it is also clear that we would expect the percentage of participants receiving general anaesthetics to decrease over the 24-month duration of the trial if it started now.\n\n\nLinear Regression Model\n \n rms::ols(formula = `General anaesthetic %` ~ rcs(days, 3), data = wyhipsurg)\n \n                  Model Likelihood    Discrimination    \n                        Ratio Test           Indexes    \n Obs      134    LR chi2     76.22    R2       0.434    \n sigma11.6048    d.f.            2    R2 adj   0.425    \n d.f.     131    Pr(> chi2) 0.0000    g       11.533    \n \n Residuals\n \n      Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n -28.2919  -7.6429   0.8064   8.3643  27.4490 \n \n \n           Coef    S.E.   t      Pr(>|t|)\n Intercept 42.3887 2.7708  15.30 <0.0001 \n days       0.0219 0.0023   9.50 <0.0001 \n days'     -0.0286 0.0029 -10.00 <0.0001 \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe thus have a predicted trial starting percentage of GA cases of 44.3% and a month-month variation (sd of residuals of ols model using restricted cubic spline) of 11.52%.\nAssumption: There may be significant variation in time to operation in those presenting to the ED with hip fractures.
