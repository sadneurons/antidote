As Anakinra had been shown during the COVID19 pandemic to reduce the ‘cytokine storm’ associated with infection with the SARS-Cov-19 virus, th e rationale of extending use to delirium, where IL-1 production has been demonstrated in animals and humans to drive inflammatory responses and altered mentation, seemed promising. The GJBRC was created in 2021 to bring basic and clinical scientists together for the rapid translation of scientific findings into life-changing therapies for major health problems.\nProf. Colm Cunningham is a globally recognised leader in the basic science of neuroinflammation and cognition. His laboratory at the Trinity College Institute of Neuroscience (TCIN) in Dublin is one of the world’s leading centres for such research. He has been the recipient of numerous awards and fellowships.\nProf. Stuart Allan leads a renowned neuroinflammation laboratory in the University of Manchester, where his groups is focused on the neuroimmunology of cerebral ischaemia. Working closely with stroke clinician-scientists and researchers at the GJBRC, the team are working on the reduction of post-stroke inflammation leading to dementia.\nProf. David Brough leads a renowned neuroinflammation laboratory in the University of Manchester, where his groups is focused on the molecular immunology of the inflammatory cascade and novel target and drug development. His team work closely with clinician-scientists at the GJBRC as well as colleagues in Oxford and further afield.\n\n\n1.3.2 Clinical Researchers\nProf. Leela Biant is the Academic head of department of Orthopaedics at the University of Manchester and a Consultant Orthopaedic Surgery Consultant at Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.

A single episode of delirium may permanently damage cognition(1) and increases the risk of dementia 3-fold over the following 3 years(2). Delirium is more common in older people and occurs in 20% of hospital inpatients and 40% of postoperative surgical patients, including those undergoing hip repair(3). Up to 90% of those who fracture their hip have underlying abnormalities in biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease (rising to 98% in those with known mild cognitive problems)(4).\nHip fracture\nIn the UK, 65,000 people fracture their hip every year(3). On average, 7% of these people will die within a month of their fracture. Postoperative delirium doubles the risk of death in the 12 months after fracture(5), especially if superimposed on pre-existing dementia(6). So, hip fracture is a major public health concern, both hastening dementia onset and causing premature death in those living with dementia. There is currently no treatment that prevents or shortens the duration of delirium, and no promising candidate. Delirium is often treated by addressing the underlying contributors (e.g. infection, pain, sedating medicines) and using sensitive nursing practice and clear communication. This can improve outcomes. However, after hip surgery, delirium impairs the early mobilisation and engagement with physiotherapy vital for good postoperative outcomes in dementia, like mobility and discharge to your own home.\nHip fracture types\nFractures of the hip are divided into intra-capsular and extracapsular. The “capsule” refers to the fibrous tissue containing a rich blood supply to the head of the hip which envelops the hip joint (ball:femoral head and socket:acetabulum). Intra-capsular fractures have the potential to disrupt the blood flow to the femoral head and cause avascular necrosis, especially if they are displaced. This is one of the reasons replacement of the femoral head, and the acetabulum (its socket) is preferred in intracapsular fractures. Extracapsular fractures occur outside the capsule and are less likely to disrupt bloodflow, occuring as they do in vascular “cancellous” bone. Thesee can be managed using a dynamic (or sliding) hip screw. Extracapsular fractres can also be subdivided into stable and unstable, depending on the radiographic appearance of the lesser trochanter fragment.\nFour aspects of compliance with NICE recommendations have been combined into a single key performance indicator, KPI 3 (NHFD Report 2021):\n\nPatients with a subtrochanteric femoral fracture should be managed with an intramedullary (IM) nail fixation.\nPatients with A1 or A2 trochanteric fractures should receive fixation with an extra-medullary fixation device, such as sliding hip screw (SHS) rather than with an IM nail.\nPatients with a displaced intracapsular hip fracture should receive a cemented arthroplasty: either hemiarthroplasty or total hip arthroplasty (THA).\nCemented THA rather than hemiarthroplasty should be offered to patients with a displaced intracapsular hip fracture who normally walk independently out of doors with no more than the use of a stick, who are not cognitively impaired and are medically fit for anaesthesia and the procedure.\n\n\n\n\nDisplaced subcapital fracture\n\n\n\n\n\nStable (left) and unstable (right) extracapsular fracture\n\n\n\n1.6.1 Review of existing evidence\nPre-clinical: IL-1 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine pivotal to the earliest stages of inflammatory response(7). It induces IL-6 and IL-8 gene expression and promotes lymphocyte differentiation and cellular immune response. The most prevalent preclinical model of delirium uses injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to switch on the inflammatory cascade. IL-1 in isolation can mimic the cognitive effects of LPS in this model(8). Blockade of IL-1 action using recombinant receptor antagonists prevents the pro-inflammatory effects of LPS in these animal models of delirium(8). Thus, blockade of this early, amplifying step in the pro-inflammatory cytokine cascade may prevent cognitive deterioration.\nClinical: In humans, IL-1 is a key driver of neuroinflammation after hip fracture, with raised CSF and serum levels(9).\nAnakinra is a specific IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) already in use for patients with autoimmune disease including arthritis and those with critical lung disease due to COVID. It is an analogue of the naturally produced human IL1 receptor antagonist."

    "text": "2 Choice of outcome measure\nTable\n\n2.0.1 Minimum clinically significant difference\nThe minmum clinically significant difference in any of the candidate delirium scales is not well established in the literature. It is clear that preventing cases of delirium will have significant positive economic outcomes for the NHS. Therefore, it would be possible to reason backwards from utilities to a minimum number of ‘prevented’ cases - delirium or “no delirium” as outcome measure. However, it is not clear that a reduction in the severity of delirium is associated with a shorter duration of delirium (intuitively appealing as that may be). It is also not clear that a reduction in the severity of delirium is associated with a shorter hospital stay per se, because no treatment has been found which effectively reduces severity. Therefore, we have chosen measures which seek to measure the primary outcome - delirium severity, and measure as secondary outcomes important clinical endpoints such as time-to-stand and time to medical fitness-for-discharge, because there are many confounding postoperative factors apart from delirium which might influence their outcome, significantly lowering the signal-noise ratio.\nOne advantage of the planned use of a Bayesian paradigm in the data analysis is that the research consumer (reader, reviewer, editor or future research groups) can establish from the multivariate posterior probability distribution the probability that Anakinra reduces delirium by a given number of points on th eoutcome scale, without this being pre-specified beforehand.\nHowever, we have specified a minimum clinicalyl significant difference of 3 points for the purposes of randomisation weighting and allocation within the provisos of the Bayesian adaptive design. \n\n\n\nAim The aim of the research is to examine whether Anakinra can reduce the incidence of delirium post hip repair in older people. Anakinra is an interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist licensed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. It is given subcutaneously twice daily, ideal for inpatients with delirium who may not be able to take oral medications. We will conduct a double-blind randomised controlled trial of Anakinra in older people after hip fracture.\nObjectives The objectives, in priority order, are to compare subcutaneous Anakinra to placebo given twice daily during the perioperative period in terms of: 1. (1°) Severity of delirium postoperatively as measured by the XXXXXXXX 2. (2°) Time to first weight bearing postoperatively 3. (3°) Time until medically fit for discharge postoperatively 4. (3°) Safety of Anakinra during the perioperative period and in wound healing 5. (3°) Tolerability of Anakinra versus placebo in terms of common side effects 6. (3°) Effect of Anakinra on 30-day mortality\nExclusion criteria: 1. Lack of a study partner or caregiver 2. Active infection 3. History of hypersensitivity to or unacceptable side effects of Anakinra 4. Current substance misuse 5. Active malignancy 6. Acute stroke or TIA 7. Currently participating in clinical trial of an investigational medicinal product (CTIMP) 8. Women of child-bearing potential 9. Neutropenia of any cause. \nWe plan to conduct this research in a sample of people presenting to the Emergency department at Wythenshawe hospital in South Manchester. Since 2017, Wythenshawe Hospital has been the regional orthopaedic trauma centre, and receives over 40 patients per month with hip fractures. The vast majority of these fractures occur in the over 65s, with a median age of 75. Higher energy injuries (for example, femoral fractures due to road traffic injuries in younger people) are usually triaged to the regional Major Trauma Centre at Manchester Royal Infirmary. Thus, the sample is pre-selected for older people with low-energy injuries, most often due to falls. Approximately 2/3 of hip fractures occur in women due to the increase in risk posed by postmenopausal osteopenia. \nAnakinra\n\n\nThis is the first use of Anakinra or any IL1RA in the treatment or prevention fo delirium in humans. Only one study mentioning a posthoc analysis of the occurence of delirium or not in the treatment of COVID19 in the Intensive Care setting is available. This was a comparison to\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1 RATIONALE\n\n\n\nOur hypothesis is the reduction in CNS IL-1 levels caused by the administration of once daily Anakinra in the period before and after surgical repair of the fractured neck of femur will result in reduced severity of delirium in those with \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Assessment and management of risk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis trial is categorised as: (delete as appropriate)"

The maximum waiting time for surgical repair of fractured neck of femur is likely to be less than 48 hours, with 60$ of people having repair by the day following presentation to the Emergency Department.

Therefore, we will continue to give doses of subcutaneous Anakinra twice daily for 72 hours after surgical repair. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.7 Dosage modifications\nDoses will be reduced if participants weigh under 50kg. For participants under 50kg a dose of Anakinra of 1.5mg/kg will be used.   Protocol deviations due to missed doses will be treated as follows:\n\nA.M. doses should be given at the usual time for A.M. medication for inpatients, usually between 8 and 9 a.m.\nDoses given after 10 a.m. will be considered protocol deviations and recorded as such. The median time at A.M. and P.M. dosing will be recorded and reported in the trial report, as will the median duration between doses.\nThe A.M. Dose will be considered “missed” if it is not given by 12 noon that day. In these cases, this should be recorded as a protocol deviation and omitted. In these cases the participant will only receive the P.M. dose. \n\n\nIntubation and I.V. sedation for any medical reason will render the measurement of delirium parameters impossible. Therefore, ICU admission, intubation or sedation with e.g. I.V Propofol will mean the participant receives no further doses of study medication or placebo, while the change in clinical status will be registered as a SUSAR.\n\nOnce a participant is withdrawn from the study, dosing with study medicine or placebo will not be reinitiated.  As the treatment will only continue for the duration of the participant’s hospitalisation, we expect there will be no reason for treatment breaks or drug-free holidays during the course of the study.  There will be no cause for increasing doses after missed doses, nor will a dosing regime be extended because of a prolngewd stay in hospital. \n\nThe dose can not be modified due to participant or relative request. The dose can not be modified sue to clinician or professional request.  Local toxicity reactions with Anakinra are not common.\nSite reactions are common after prolonged dosing and usually result in inflammation, erythema and discoloration around injection sites. As trial participants will only be receiving 8 to 10 injections, and with the benefit of the rotation of sites, we do not anticipate site reactions which would result in either unblinding or discomfort for participants. If site reactions occur, they will be treated as per clinical guidance, by ensuring rotation of the injection site, providing pain relief and careful participant positioning. Site reactions will be reported as a Serious Adverse Event of Interest, but treatment may continue.\nAnaphylactic reactions will be dealt with using the local anaphylaxis guidance for Manchester Foundation Trust, and referred for post-anaphylaxis care if possible at the Greater Manchester Rapid Access Anaphylaxis Clinic.\n\n\n\n8.8 Known drug reactions and interaction with other therapies\n\n\n8.8.1 Contra-indications (BNF)\nActive infection; neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count less than 1.5 x 109/litre)—do not initiate; pre-existing malignancy\n\n\n8.8.2 Cautions (BNF)\nElderly; history of asthma (increased risk of serious infection); history of recurrent infection; predisposition to infection\n\n\n8.8.3 Interactions (BNF)\nAbatacept: Anakinra is predicted to increase the risk of generalised infection (possibly life-threatening) when given with Abatacept.

It does make a proportional-odds assumption testable using the parallel test. The coefficients can be interpreted as the log-odds of a one point increase in the scale score, \\(y\\), with a one point (or one unit) increase in the predictor variable \\(x\\).\nAssumption: While delirium is by its nature a fluctuating condition, we assume there will be correlation within participants in delirium scale scores over time.\nSolution: Mixed effects models will allow for an autoregressive correlation structure and regularisation of the model. Frequentist ordinal logistic mixed models are facilitated by R packages ‘ordinal’ and ‘rms’ and Bayesian mixed effects ordinal regression models are facilitated by packages ‘brms’ (with cumulative log-odds link function) and ‘rmsb’. These have been used in simulation below.\nAssumption: There may be significant difference in the “deliriogenic” potential of different anaesthetic methods (spinal/GA) in those presenting to the ED with hip fractures. The descriptive statistics for Wythenshawe hospital can be found above\nSolution Because the nature of the anaesthetic (spinal versus general) may relate to the nature of the participants’ comorbidities and the presence or absence of preoperative delirium, we will use a minimisation strategy to ensure equal numbers of spinal and general anaesthetic procedures in each trial arm. The numbers of participants having GA will vary month-month, but in the forecast above the split is approximately 50/50."

It is generally beneficial promoting resistance, repair and recovery. However, when the process of inflammation is not controlled properly it becomes damaging. This is the case during chronic diseases such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, and after acute injuries such as stroke. There are many aspects of the inflammatory response that are not known. Through increased understanding of inflammation we may identify new drug targets that could ultimately reduce the severity of many diseases. My lab aims to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms that contribute to inflammation.\nUniversity of Manchester\n\n\n\nProf. Colm Cunningham\nMy main research interests are in neurodegeneration and in brain inflammation. In particular, I am interested in how systemic insults such as infection, inflammation and injury interact with, and influence, ongoing neurodegeneration and associated brain inflammation. I have an ongoing interest in sickness behaviour responses induced by bacterial and viral infections/mimetics and our observation of an exaggeration of these responses in animals/persons with ongoing brain inflammation has brought 2 of my major interests together: Such responses in the aged or demented incorporate episodes of delirium, a phenomenon that remains unexplained and which now represents a major research interest for me. I have been awarded Fellowships by the Wellcome Trust to develop animal models of delirium during dementia and I maintain long-standing collaborations, with the department of Experimental Psychology in Oxford University and the CNS inflammation group in the University of Southampton, exploring some of these issues. More recently we have been funded by the NIH and Simon’s Foundation (USA) to study the interactions between systemic inflammation, brain metabolism and cognitive function in models of hypocholinergic function, brain amyloidosis and autism. Collectively, these avenues are aimed at moving towards defining the role of activated microglia in ageing and neurodegenerative disease, while considering the impact of systemic infections on the brain in multiple vulnerable neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental states. As an experimental approach, I believe in the need for the combined molecular, behavioural and neuropathological / neuroanatomical study of animal models of disease and CNS dysfunction.\nTrinity College Dublin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPicture\nName\nBiography\nAffiliation\n\n\n\n\n\nProf. Leela Biant\nProf. Leela Biant is Academic Head of Dept Trauma & Orthopaedic Surgery at University of Manchester and Honorary Consultant Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgeon, Central Manchester University Hospitals.
